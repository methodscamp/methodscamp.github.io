## Description {.unnumbered}

Welcome to Introduction to Methods for Political Science, aka “Methods Camp”! In the past our incoming students have told us their math skills are rusty and they would like to be better prepared for UT’s methods courses. Methods Camp is designed to give everyone a chance to brush up on some skills in preparation for the Stats I and Formal Theory I courses. The other goal of Methods Camp is to allow you to get to know your cohort. We hope that struggling with matrix algebra and the dreaded chain rule will still prove to be a good bonding exercise.

As you can see from the above schedule, we’ll be meeting on Friday, August 11th as well as from Monday, August 14th through Thursday, August 17th. Classes at UT begin the start of the following week on Monday, August 22nd. Below is a tentaive schedule outlining what will be covered in the class, although we may rearrange things a bit if we find we’re going too slowly or too quickly through any of the material.

## Course outline {.unnumbered}

**Friday morning: R and RStudio** 
* Introductions
* RStudio (materials are on the website as zipped RStudio projects)
* Objects (vectors, matrices, data frames)
* Basic functions (mean(), length(), etc.)

02 Friday afternoon: Tidyverse basics I 
- Packages: installation and loading (including the tidyverse)
- Data wrangling with dplyr (basic verbs, including the new .by = syntax)
- Data visualization basics with ggplot2
- Data loading (.csv, .rds, .dta/.sav, .xlsx)
- Quarto fundamentals

03 Monday morning: Matrices 
- Matrices
- Systems of linear equations
- Matrix operations (multiplication, transpose, inverse, determinant).
- Solving systems of linear equations in matrix form (and why that’s cool)
- Introduction to OLS

04 Monday afternoon: Tidyverse basics II 
- Data merging and pivoting (*_join(), pivot_*())
- Value recoding (if_else(), case_when())
- Missing values
- Data visualization extensions: facets, text annotations

05 Tuesday morning: Functions and loops 
- Functions
- For-loops and lapply()
- Finding R help (help files, effective Googling, ChatGPT)

06 Tuesday afternoon: Calculus
- Limits (not sure how to teach this in an R-centric way yet, but there must be a way)
- Derivatives (symbolic, numerical, automatic)
- Integrals

07 Wednesday morning: Probability 
- Concepts: probability, random variables, etc.
- PMF, PDF, CDF, etc.
- Distributions (binomial, normal; different functions in R and how to use them)
- Expectation and variance

08 Wednesday afternoon: Simulations 
- Simulations (ideas, seed setting, etc.)
- Sampling
- Bootstrapping

09 Thursday morning: Text analysis 
- String manipulation with stringr
- Simple text analysis (counts, tf-idf, etc.) with tidytext and visualization

10 Thursday afternoon: Wrap-up 
- Project management fundamentals (RStudio projects, keeping raw data, etc.)
- Self-study resources and materials
- Other software (Overleaf, Zotero, etc.)
- Methods at UT
