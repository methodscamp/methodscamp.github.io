## Description {.unnumbered}

Welcome to Introduction to Methods for Political Science, aka "Methods Camp"! Methods Camp is designed to give everyone a chance to brush up on some skills in preparation for the introductory Statistics and Formal Theory courses. The other goal of Methods Camp is to allow you to get to know your cohort. We hope that matrix algebra and the chain rule will still prove to be good bonding exercises!

As you can see from the above schedule, we'll be meeting on Monday, August 18th, through Thursday, August 21st. Classes at UT begin the start of the following week on Monday, August 25th. Below is a tentative schedule outlining what will be covered in the class, although we may rearrange things if we find we're going too slowly or too quickly through the material.
