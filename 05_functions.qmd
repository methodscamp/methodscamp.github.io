# Functions and loops

## Basics

### What is a function?

Informally, a function is anything that takes input(s) and gives one defined output. There are always three main parts:

- The input ($x$ values, or each value in the domain)

- The relationship of interest

- The output ($y$ values, or a unique value in the range)

::: callout-note
"$f(x) = \space ...$ is the classic notation for writing a function, but we can also use"$y = \space ...$". This is because $y$ is"a function of" $x$, so $y=f(x)$.
:::

Let's take a look at an example and break down the structure:

$$f(x) = 3x + 4$$

-   $x$ is the *input* (some value) that the function takes.

-   For any $x$, we multiply by three and add 4, which is the *relationship*.

-   Finally, $f(x)$ or $y$ is the unique result, or the *output*.

The most common name to give a function is, predictably, "$f$", but we can have other names such as "$g$" or "$h$". The choice is yours.

::: callout-important
When reading out loud, we say "\[name of function\] of x equals \[relationship\]. For example, $f(x) = x^2$ is referred to as "f of x equals x squared."

## Functions in R

Often we need to create our own functions in R. To build them: we use the keyword `function` alongside the following syntax: `function_name <- function(argumentnames){ operation }`

-  `function_name`: the name of the function, that will be stored as an object in the R environment. Make the name concise and memorable!

-  `function(argumentnames)`: the inputs of the function.

-  `{ operation }`: a set of commands that are run in a predefined order every time we call the function.

For example, we can create a function that multiplies a number by 2:

```{r}
mult_by_two <- function(x){x * 2}
```

```{r}
mult_by_two(x = 5) # we can also omit the argument name (x =)
```

If the function body works for vectors, our custom function will do too:

```{r}
mult_by_two(1:10)
```

We can also automate more complicated tasks such as calculating the area of a circle from its radius:

```{r}
calc_circle_area <- function(r){
    pi * r ^ 2
}
calc_circle_area(r = 3)
```

::: callout-note
#### Exercise

Create a function that calculates the area of a circle *from its diameter*. So `your_function(d = 6)` should yield the same result as the example above. Your code:


:::

Functions can take more than one argument/input. In a silly example, let's generalize our first function:

```{r}
mult_by <- function(x, mult){x * mult}
```

```{r}
mult_by(x = 1:5, mult = 10)
```

```{r}
mult_by(1:5, mult = 10)
```

```{r}
mult_by(1:5, 10)
```

To graph a function, we'll use our friend `ggplot2` and `stat_function()`:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
ggplot() +
  stat_function(fun = mult_by_two, 
                xlim = c(-5, 5)) # domain over which we will plot the function
```


User-defined functions have endless possibilities! We encourage you to get creative and try to automate new tasks when possible, especially if they are repetitive.

::: callout-tip

Functions in R can also take non-numeric inputs. For example:

```{r}
say_my_name <- function(my_name){paste("My name is", my_name)}
```

```{r}
say_my_name("Inigo Montoya")
```

## Common types of functions

### Linear functions

$$y=mx+b$$

Linear functions are those whose graph is a straight line (in two dimensions).

- $m$ is the slope, or the rate of change (common interpretation: for every one unit increase in $x$, $y$ increases $m$ units).

- $b$ is the y intercept, or the constant term (the value of $y$ when $x=0$).

Below is a graph of the function $y = 3x + 4$:

```{r}
ggplot() +
  stat_function(fun = function(x){3 * x + 4}, # we don't need to create an object
                xlim = c(-5, 5)) 
```

### Quadratic functions

$$y=ax^2 + bx + c$$

-   These lines have one curve.

-   $a$, $b$, and $c$ don't have well-defined meanings here.

-   If $a$ is negative, the function opens downward; if $a$ is positive,it opens upward.

-   Note that $x^2$ always returns positive values.

-   Below is a graph of the function $y = x^2$:

```{r}
ggplot() +
  stat_function(fun = function(x){x ^ 2},
                xlim = c(-5, 5)) 
```

::: callout-note
#### Exercise

Social scientists commonly use linear or quadratic functions as theoretical simplifications of social phenomena. Can you give any examples?

:::

### Cubic functions

$$y=ax^3 + bx^2 + cx +d$$

-   These lines (generally) have two curves (inflection points).

-   $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ don't have well-defined meanings here.

-   Below is a graph of the function $y = x^3$:

```{r}
ggplot() +
  stat_function(fun = function(x){x ^ 3},
                xlim = c(-5, 5)) 
```

### Polynomial functions

$$y=ax^n + bx^{n-1} + ... + c$$ 

- These functions have (maximum) $n-1$ changes in direction (turning points). 

- They also have (maximum) $n$ x-intercepts. - They can be made arbitrarily precise.

- These functions have (maximum) $n-1$ changes in direction (turning points).

- They also have (maximum) $n$ x-intercepts.

- They can be made arbitrarily precise.

- Below is a graph of the function $y = \frac{1}{4}x^4 - 5 x^2 + x$. 

```{r}
ggplot() +
  stat_function(fun = function(x){1/4 * x ^ 4 - 5 * x ^ 2 + x},
                xlim = c(-5, 5)) 
```

### Exponential functions

$$y = ab^{x}$$

-   Here our input ($x$), is the exponent.

-   Below is a graph of the function $y = 2^x$:

```{r}
ggplot() +
  stat_function(fun = function(x){2 ^ x},
                xlim = c(-5, 5)) 
```

## Logarithms and exponents

### Logarithms

-   Logarithms are basically the opposite (inverse) of exponents.

-   They ask how many times you must raise the base to get $x$.

-   $log_a(b)=x$ is asking "a raised to what power x gives b?"

-   $\log_3(81) = 4$ because $3^4=81$

::: callout-warning
Logarithms can be *undefined*. The base cannot be 0, 1, or negative.
:::

### Relationships

If, $$ log_ax=b$$ then, $$a^{log_{a}x}=a^b$$ and $$x=a^b$$

### Basic rules

$$\dfrac{\log_x n}{\log_x m} = \log_m n$$

$$\log_x(ab) = \log_xa + \log_xb $$

$$\log_x\left(\frac{a}{b}\right) = \log_xa - \log_xb$$

$$\log_xa^b = b \log_x a$$

$$\log_x 1 = 0$$

$$log_{x}x=1$$

$$m^{\log_m(a)} = a$$

### Natural logarithms

-   We most often use natural logarithms for our purposes.

-   This means $log_e(x)$, which is usually written as $ln(x)$.

::: callout-important
$e \approx 2.7183$.
:::

-   $ln(x)$ and its exponent opposite, $e^x$, have nice properties when we perform calculus.

### Illustration of $e$

-   Imagine you invest \$1 in a bank and receive 100% interest for one year, and the bank pays you back once a year: $$(1+1)^1= 2$$

-   When it pays you twice a year with compound interest:

$$(1+1/2)^2=2.25$$

-   If it pays you three times a year:

$$(1+1/3)^3=2.37...$$

-   What will happen when the bank pays you once a month? Once a day?

$$(1+\frac{1}{n})^{n}$$

-   However, there is limit to what you can get.

$$\lim_{n\to\infty} (1 + \dfrac{1}{n})^n = 2.7183... = e$$

-   For any interest rate $k$ and number of times the bank pays you $t$: $$\lim_{n\to\infty} (1 + \dfrac{k}{n})^{nt} = e^{kt}$$

-   $e$ is important for defining *exponential growth*. Since $ln(e^x) = x$, the natural logarithm helps us turn exponential functions into linear ones.

::: callout-note
## Exercise

Solve the problems below, simplifying as much as you can. $$log_{10}(1000)$$ $$log_2(\dfrac{8}{32})$$ $$10^{log_{10}(300)}$$ $$ln(1)$$ $$ln(e^2)$$ $$ln(5e)$$
:::

### Logarithms in R

By default, R's `log()` function computes natural logarithms:

```{r}
log(100)
```

We can change this behavior with the `base =` argument:

```{r}
log(100, base = 10)
```


## Composite functions (functions of functions)

-   Functions can take other functions as inputs, e.g., $f(g(x))$.

-   This means that the outside function takes the output of the inside function as its input.

-   Say we have the exterior function f(x)=$x^2$ and the interior function g(x)=$x-3$.

-   Then if we want f(g(x)), we would subtract 3 from any input, and then square the result.

-   We write this $(x-3)^2$, not $x^2-3$.
