Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,30,A BRIEF SKETCH OF THE LIFE OF MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT.
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,31,M. Wollstonecraft was born in 1759.  Her father was so great a
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,32,"wanderer, that the place of her birth is uncertain; she supposed,"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,33,"however, it was London, or Epping Forest:  at the latter place she"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,34,spent the first five years of her life.  In early youth she
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,35,"exhibited traces of exquisite sensibility, soundness of"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,36,"understanding, and decision of character; but her father being a"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,37,"despot in his family, and her mother one of his subjects, Mary,"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,38,derived little benefit from their parental training.  She received
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,39,no literary instructions but such as were to be had in ordinary day
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,40,schools.  Before her sixteenth year she became acquainted with Mr.
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,41,"Clare a clergyman, and Miss Frances Blood; the latter, two years"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,42,older than herself; who possessing good taste and some knowledge of
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,43,"the fine arts, seems to have given the first impulse to the"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,44,"formation of her character.  At the age of nineteen, she left her"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,45,"parents, and resided with a Mrs. Dawson for two years; when she"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,46,"returned to the parental roof to give attention to her mother,"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,47,whose ill health made her presence necessary.  On the death of her
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,48,"mother, Mary bade a final adieu to her father's house, and became"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,49,"the inmate of F. Blood; thus situated, their intimacy increased,"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,50,and a strong attachment was reciprocated.  In 1783 she commenced a
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,51,"day school at Newington green, in conjunction with her friend, F."
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,52,"Blood.  At this place she became acquainted with Dr. Price, to whom"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,53,she became strongly attached; the regard was mutual.
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,54,"It is said that she became a teacher from motives of benevolence,"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,55,"or rather philanthropy, and during the time she continued in the"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,56,"profession, she gave proof of superior qualification for the"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,57,performance of its arduous and important duties.  Her friend and
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,58,"coadjutor married and removed to Lisbon, in Portugal, where she"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,59,died of a pulmonary disease; the symptoms of which were visible
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,60,"before her marriage.  So true was Mary's attachment to her, that"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,61,"she entrusted her school to the care of others, for the purpose of"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,62,"attending Frances in her closing scene.  She aided, as did Dr."
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,63,"Young, in ""Stealing Narcissa a grave.""  Her mind was expanded by"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,64,"this residence in a foreign country, and though clear of religious"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,65,"bigotry before, she took some instructive lessons on the evils of"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,66,"superstition, and intolerance."
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,67,"On her return she found the school had suffered by her absence, and"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,68,"having previously decided to apply herself to literature, she now"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,69,"resolved to commence.  In 1787 she made, or received, proposals"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,70,"from Johnson, a publisher in London, who was already acquainted"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,71,"with her talents as an author.  During the three subsequent years,"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,72,"she was actively engaged, more in translating, condensing, and"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,73,"compiling, than in the production of original works.  At this time"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,74,"she laboured under much depression of spirits, for the loss of her"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,75,"friend; this rather increased, perhaps, by the publication of"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,76,"""Mary, a novel,"" which was mostly composed of incidents and"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,77,reflections connected with their intimacy.
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,78,"The pecuniary concerns of her father becoming embarrassed, Mary"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,79,"practised a rigid economy in her expenditures, and with her savings"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,80,"was enabled to procure her sisters and brothers situations, to"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,81,"which without her aid, they could not have had access; her father"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,82,was sustained at length from her funds; she even found means to
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,83,take under her protection an orphan child.
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,84,She had acquired a facility in the arrangement and expression of
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,85,"thoughts, in her avocation of translator, and compiler, which was"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,86,no doubt of great use to her afterward.  It was not long until she
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,87,had occasion for them.  The eminent Burke produced his celebrated
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,88,"""Reflections on the Revolution in France.""  Mary full of sentiments"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,89,"of liberty, and indignant at what she thought subversive of it,"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,90,seized her pen and produced the first attack upon that famous work.
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,91,"It succeeded well, for though intemperate and contemptuous, it was"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,92,vehemently and impetuously eloquent; and though Burke was beloved
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,93,"by the enlightened friends of freedom, they were dissatisfied and"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,94,disgusted with what they deemed an outrage upon it.
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,95,"It is said that Mary, had not wanted confidence in her own powers"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,96,"before, but the reception this work met from the public, gave her"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,97,"an opportunity of judging what those powers were, in the estimation"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,98,"of others.  It was shortly after this, that she commenced the work"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,99,to which these remarks are prefixed.  What are its merits will be
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,100,decided in the judgment of each reader; suffice it to say she
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,101,"appears to have stept forth boldly, and singly, in defence of that"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,102,"half of the human race, which by the usages of all society, whether"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,103,"savage or civilized, have been kept from attaining their proper"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,104,dignity--their equal rank as rational beings.  It would appear that
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,105,the disguise used in placing on woman the silken fetters which
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,106,"bribed her into endurance, and even love of slavery, but increased"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,107,the opposition of our authoress:  she would have had more patience
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,108,"with rude, brute coercion, than with that imposing gallantry,"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,109,"which, while it affects to consider woman as the pride, and"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,110,"ornament of creation, degrades her to a toy--an appendage--a"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,111,"cypher.  The work was much reprehended, and as might well be"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,112,"expected, found its greatest enemies in the pretty soft"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,113,creatures--the spoiled children of her own sex.  She accomplished
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,114,it in six weeks.
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,115,"In 1792 she removed to Paris, where she became acquainted with"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,116,"Gilbert Imlay, of the United States.  And from this acquaintance"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,117,"grew an attachment, which brought the parties together, without"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,118,"legal formalities, to which she objected on account of some family"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,119,"embarrassments, in which he would thereby become involved.  The"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,120,"engagement was however considered by her of the most sacred nature,"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,121,"and they formed the plan of emigrating to America, where they"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,122,should be enabled to accomplish it.  These were the days of
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,123,"Robespierrean cruelty, and Imlay left Paris for Havre, whither"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,124,"after a time Mary followed him.  They continued to reside there,"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,125,"until he left Havre for London, under pretence of business, and"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,126,"with a promise of rejoining her soon at Paris, which however he did"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,127,"not, but in 1795 sent for her to London.  In the mean time she had"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,128,"become the mother of a female child, whom she called Frances in"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,129,commemoration of her early friendship.
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,130,"Before she went to England, she had some gloomy forebodings that"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,131,"the affections of Imlay, had waned, if they were not estranged from"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,132,"her; on her arrival, those forebodings were sorrowfully confirmed."
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,133,His attentions were too formal and constrained to pass unobserved
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,134,"by her penetration, and though he ascribed his manner, and his"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,135,"absence, to business duties, she saw his affection for her was only"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,136,"something to be remembered.  To use her own expression, ""Love, dear"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,137,delusion!  Rigorous reason has forced me to resign; and now my
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,138,"rational prospects are blasted, just as I have learned to be"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,139,"contented with rational enjoyments.""  To pretend to depict her"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,140,misery at this time would be futile; the best idea can be formed of
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,141,"it from the fact that she had planned her own destruction, from"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,142,which Imlay prevented her.  She conceived the idea of suicide a
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,143,"second time, and threw herself into the Thames; she remained in the"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,144,"water, until consciousness forsook her, but she was taken up and"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,145,resuscitated.  After divers attempts to revive the affections of
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,146,"Imlay, with sundry explanations and professions on his part,"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,147,"through the lapse of two years, she resolved finally to forgo all"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,148,"hope of reclaiming him, and endeavour to think of him no more in"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,149,connexion with her future prospects.  In this she succeeded so
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,150,"well, that she afterwards had a private interview with him, which"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,151,did not produce any painful emotions.
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,152,In 1796 she revived or improved an acquaintance which commenced
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,153,"years before with Wm. Godwin, author of ""Political Justice,"" and"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,154,other works of great notoriety.  Though they had not been
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,155,"favourably impressed with each other on their former acquaintance,"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,156,they now met under circumstances which permitted a mutual and just
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,157,appreciation of character.  Their intimacy increased by regular and
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,158,almost imperceptible degrees.  The partiality they conceived for
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,159,"each other was, according to her biographer, ""In the most refined"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,160,style of love.  It grew with equal advances in the mind of each.
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,161,It would have been impossible for the most minute observer to have
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,162,"said who was before, or who after.  One sex did not take the"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,166,toil-spreader or the prey in the affair.  When in the course of
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,167,"things the disclosure came, there was nothing in a manner for"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,168,"either to disclose to the other."""

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,178,regret; we can scarcely repress the murmur that she had not been

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,180,to witness the brightness and serenity which might have succeeded.
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,181,But thus it is; we may trace the cause to anti-social arrangements;

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,408,abrogated in favour of woman.  This physical superiority cannot be
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,409,denied--and it is a noble prerogative!  But not content with this
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,410,"natural pre-eminence, men endeavour to sink us still lower, merely"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,411,"to render us alluring objects for a moment; and women, intoxicated"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,412,"by the adoration which men, under the influence of their senses,"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,415,in their society.
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,416,I am aware of an obvious inference: from every quarter have I heard
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,417,exclamations against masculine women; but where are they to be

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,426,that they may every day grow more and more masculine.
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,427,This discussion naturally divides the subject.  I shall first
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,428,"consider women in the grand light of human creatures, who, in"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,429,"common with men, are placed on this earth to unfold their"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,430,faculties; and afterwards I shall more particularly point out their

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,432,"I wish also to steer clear of an error, which many respectable"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,433,writers have fallen into; for the instruction which has hitherto

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,438,appear to be in the most natural state.  Perhaps the seeds of false

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,0,452,"is, for the present, sufficient; and I have only alluded to the"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,1,549,THE RIGHTS AND INVOLVED DUTIES OF MANKIND CONSIDERED.
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,1,550,"In the present state of society, it appears necessary to go back to"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,1,551,"first principles in search of the most simple truths, and to"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,1,552,dispute with some prevailing prejudice every inch of ground.  To
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,1,553,"clear my way, I must be allowed to ask some plain questions, and"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,1,554,the answers will probably appear as unequivocal as the axioms on
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,1,555,"which reasoning is built; though, when entangled with various"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,1,556,"motives of action, they are formally contradicted, either by the"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,1,557,words or conduct of men.
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,1,558,In what does man's pre-eminence over the brute creation consist?
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,1,559,The answer is as clear as that a half is less than the whole; in
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,1,560,Reason.
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,1,561,What acquirement exalts one being above another?  Virtue; we

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,1,563,For what purpose were the passions implanted?  That man by
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,1,564,struggling with them might attain a degree of knowledge denied to
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,1,565,the brutes:  whispers Experience.
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,1,566,Consequently the perfection of our nature and capability of
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,1,567,"happiness, must be estimated by the degree of reason, virtue, and"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,1,569,"which bind society:  and that from the exercise of reason,"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,1,570,"knowledge and virtue naturally flow, is equally undeniable, if"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,1,571,mankind be viewed collectively.

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,2,928,every being may become virtuous by the exercise of its own reason;

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,2,935,individual to attain such habits of virtue as will render it
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,2,936,"independent.  In fact, it is a farce to call any being virtuous"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,2,937,whose virtues do not result from the exercise of its own reason.
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,2,938,"This was Rousseau's opinion respecting men:  I extend it to women,"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,2,947,that unsophisticated affections impart.  But for this epoch we must

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,2,950,off their gaudy hereditary trappings; and if then women do not

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2201,"we die.  Women, I argue from analogy, are degraded by the same"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2252,"The power of generalizing ideas, of drawing comprehensive"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2258,when it leaves the body?
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2259,This power has not only been denied to women; but writers have
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2260,"insisted that it is inconsistent, with a few exceptions, with their"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2261,"sexual character.  Let men prove this, and I shall grant that woman"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2262,"only exists for man.  I must, however, previously remark, that the"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2263,"power of generalizing ideas, to any great extent, is not very"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2264,common amongst men or women.  But this exercise is the true
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2265,cultivation of the understanding; and every thing conspires to
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2266,render the cultivation of the understanding more difficult in the
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2267,female than the male world.
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2268,I am naturally led by this assertion to the main subject of the

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2272,I shall not go back to the remote annals of antiquity to trace the

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2275,situations equally retards the progress of reason.  The grand
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2276,source of female folly and vice has ever appeared to me to arise
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2277,from narrowness of mind; and the very constitution of civil
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2278,governments has put almost insuperable obstacles in the way to
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2279,prevent the cultivation of the female understanding:  yet virtue
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2280,can be built on no other foundation!  The same obstacles are thrown
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2281,"in the way of the rich, and the same consequences ensue."
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2282,Necessity has been proverbially termed the mother of invention; the

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2287,knowledge goaded on by necessity?  Happy is it when people have the
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2288,cares of life to struggle with; for these struggles prevent their

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2762,would also have been very different.  The wife would not have had
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2763,"that sensibility, of which self is the centre, and reason might"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2764,"have taught her not to expect, and not even to be flattered by the"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2767,account of his virtues; and the sister might have been able to

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2769,dependence.

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2773,"momentary flashes of sensibility, but of affections.  And, perhaps,"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2774,"in the education of both sexes, the most difficult task is so to"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2775,"adjust instruction as not to narrow the understanding, whilst the"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2776,"heart is warmed by the generous juices of spring, just raised by"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2781,with capricious fancies; or mere notable women.  The latter are

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2785,they possess neither greatness of mind nor taste.  The intellectual
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2786,world is shut against them; take them out of their family or
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2787,"neighbourhood, and they stand still; the mind finding no"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2789,"have never sought to relish, but frequently to despise.  The"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2790,"sentiments and taste of more cultivated minds appear ridiculous,"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2791,even in those whom chance and family connexions have led them to
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2792,love; but in mere acquaintance they think it all affectation.
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2793,"A man of sense can only love such a woman on account of her sex,"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2796,clothes made of the very best materials.  A man of her own size of
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2797,"understanding would, probably, not agree so well with her; for he"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2803,superiority that only rests on the arbitrary distinction of
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2804,"fortune.  The evil is sometimes more serious, and domestics are"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2809,"costly manner--and, whether, this attention arises from vanity or"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2810,"fondness, it is equally pernicious."

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2823,sense; for even corporeal accomplishments cannot be acquired with

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2825,strengthened by exercise.  Without a foundation of principles taste
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2826,is superficial; and grace must arise from something deeper than
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2827,"imitation.  The imagination, however, is heated, and the feelings"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2830,though it becomes too tender.
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2831,These women are often amiable; and their hearts are really more

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2837,male acquaintance.  These are the fair defects in nature; the women
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2838,"who appear to be created not to enjoy the fellowship of man, but to"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2841,some dignity to the appetite that draws him to them.  Gracious
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2842,Creator of the whole human race! hast thou created such a being as

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2879,"the temper, the first and most important branch of education,"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2880,requires the sober steady eye of reason; a plan of conduct equally
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2881,distant from tyranny and indulgence; yet these are the extremes
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2882,that people of sensibility alternately fall into; always shooting
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2883,beyond the mark.  I have followed this train of reasoning much
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2884,"further, till I have concluded, that a person of genius is the most"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2885,"improper person to be employed in education, public or private."
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2886,"Minds of this rare species see things too much in masses, and"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2894,"because liveliness of fancy, and a tenacious comprehension of mind,"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2895,are scarcely compatible with that pliant urbanity which leads a

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2897,instead of roughly confronting them.
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2898,"But, treating of education or manners, minds of a superior class"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2916,"genius, in Cowley, Milton, and Pope, (Many other names might be"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2928,"the perfection of woman--mere beauty of features and complexion,"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2932,"women do not acquire before thirty, any more than men.  The little"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2936,person of taste.  In the countenance of girls we only look for

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2943,At twenty the beauty of both sexes is equal; but the libertinism of

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2947,"French who admit more of mind into their notions of beauty, give"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,4,2948,"the preference to women of thirty.  I mean to say, that they allow"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4702,acquired any other way only hardens the heart and perplexes the

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4722,them.  An observation which I have often made will illustrate my
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4723,"meaning.  When in a circle of strangers, or acquaintances, a person"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4724,"of moderate abilities, asserts an opinion with heat, I will venture"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4725,"to affirm, for I have traced this fact home, very often, that it is"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4726,a prejudice.  These echoes have a high respect for the
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4727,"understanding of some relation or friend, and without fully"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4728,"comprehending the opinions, which they are so eager to retail, they"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4731,I know that a kind of fashion now prevails of respecting

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4733,"humanity and armed by reason, he is superciliously asked, whether"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4734,"his ancestors were fools.  No, I should reply; opinions, at first,"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4735,"of every description, were all, probably, considered, and therefore"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4736,"were founded on some reason; yet not unfrequently, of course, it"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4737,"was rather a local expedient than a fundamental principle, that"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4738,"would be reasonable at all times.  But, moss-covered opinions"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4739,"assume the disproportioned form of prejudices, when they are"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4740,indolently adopted only because age has given them a venerable

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4743,because they are prejudices?  A prejudice is a fond obstinate
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4744,"persuasion, for which we can give no reason; for the moment a"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4745,"reason can be given for an opinion, it ceases to be a prejudice,"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4746,though it may be an error in judgment:  and are we then advised to
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4747,cherish opinions only to set reason at defiance?  This mode of
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4748,"arguing, if arguing it may be called, reminds me of what is"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4749,vulgarly termed a woman's reason.  For women sometimes declare that

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4754,"bring them to a point, to start fairly from, you must go back to"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4755,the simple principles that were antecedent to the prejudices
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4756,broached by power; and it is ten to one but you are stopped by the

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4758,"false as they are abstractly true.  Nay, it may be inferred, that"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4759,"reason has whispered some doubts, for it generally happens that"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4760,people assert their opinions with the greatest heat when they begin
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4761,to waver; striving to drive out their own doubts by convincing
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4762,"their opponent, they grow angry when those gnawing doubts are"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4763,thrown back to prey on themselves.

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4765,give.  A sagacious parent or tutor may strengthen the body and

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4767,but the honey must be the reward of the individual's own industry.
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4768,It is almost as absurd to attempt to make a youth wise by the

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4771,Many of those children whose conduct has been most narrowly
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4772,"watched, become the weakest men, because their instructors only"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4776,"advances.  The business of education in this case, is only to"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,5,4777,conduct the shooting tendrils to a proper pole; yet after laying

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4822,surprising that women every where appear a defect in nature?  Is it

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4826,The great advantages which naturally result from storing the mind
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4827,"with knowledge, are obvious from the following considerations.  The"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4828,association of our ideas is either habitual or instantaneous; and
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4829,the latter mode seems rather to depend on the original temperature
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4830,"of the mind than on the will.  When the ideas, and matters of fact,"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4831,"are once taken in, they lie by for use, till some fortuitous"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4832,circumstance makes the information dart into the mind with
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4833,"illustrative force, that has been received at very different"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4834,periods of our lives.  Like the lightning's flash are many
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4835,"recollections; one idea assimilating and explaining another, with"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4836,astonishing rapidity.  I do not now allude to that quick perception
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4837,"of truth, which is so intuitive that it baffles research, and makes"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4863,I must be allowed to explain myself.  The generality of people

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4942,sublime; and the confused consciousness of humility may render the

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4954,Common passions are excited by common qualities.  Men look for
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4955,beauty and the simper of good humoured docility:  women are
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4956,captivated by easy manners: a gentleman-like man seldom fails to

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4962,their own ground.  Rendered gay and giddy by the whole tenor of
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4963,"their lives, the very aspect of wisdom, or the severe graces of"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4964,virtue must have a lugubrious appearance to them; and produce a
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4965,"kind of restraint from which they and love, sportive child,"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4966,"naturally revolt.  Without taste, excepting of the lighter kind,"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4967,"for taste is the offspring of judgment, how can they discover, that"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4968,true beauty and grace must arise from the play of the mind? and how

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4972,"take fire, and thus mount to passion.  No, I repeat it, the love"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4973,"cherished by such minds, must have grosser fuel!"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4974,The inference is obvious; till women are led to exercise their
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4975,"understandings, they should not be satirized for their attachment"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4976,"to rakes; nor even for being rakes at heart, when it appears to be"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4977,the inevitable consequence of their education.  They who live to
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4978,"please must find their enjoyments, their happiness, in pleasure!"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4979,"It is a trite, yet true remark, that we never do any thing well,"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4985,"they would turn with disgust from a rake.  Reasoning then, as well"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4986,"as feeling, the only province of woman, at present, they might"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4987,"easily guard against exterior graces, and quickly learn to despise"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4988,the sensibility that had been excited and hackneyed in the ways of
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4989,"women, whose trade was vice; and allurement's wanton airs.  They"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4990,"would recollect that the flame, (one must use appropriate"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4991,"expressions,) which they wished to light up, had been exhausted by"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4992,"lust, and that the sated appetite, losing all relish for pure and"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4993,"simple pleasures, could only be roused by licentious arts of"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4994,variety.  What satisfaction could a woman of delicacy promise
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4995,"herself in a union with such a man, when the very artlessness of"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4996,her affection might appear insipid?  Thus does Dryden describe the
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4997,situation:
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,4998,"""Where love is duty on the female side,"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5001,them to act accordingly.  In the choice of a husband they should
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5002,not be led astray by the qualities of a lover--for a lover the
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5003,"husband, even supposing him to be wise and virtuous, cannot long"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5004,remain.
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5005,"Were women more rationally educated, could they take a more"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5007,once in their lives; and after marriage calmly let passion subside
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5008,"into friendship--into that tender intimacy, which is the best"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5009,"refuge from care; yet is built on such pure, still affections, that"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5010,idle jealousies would not be allowed to disturb the discharge of
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5011,"the sober duties of life, nor to engross the thoughts that ought to"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5012,be otherwise employed.  This is a state in which many men live; but
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5013,"few, very few women.  And the difference may easily be accounted"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5014,"for, without recurring to a sexual character.  Men, for whom we are"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5015,"told women are made, have too much occupied the thoughts of women;"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5016,"and this association has so entangled love, with all their motives"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5017,"of action; and, to harp a little on an old string, having been"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5018,"solely employed either to prepare themselves to excite love, or"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5019,"actually putting their lessons in practice, they cannot live"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5020,"without love.  But, when a sense of duty, or fear of shame, obliges"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5021,them to restrain this pampered desire of pleasing beyond certain
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5022,"lengths, too far for delicacy, it is true, though far from"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5023,"criminality, they obstinately determine to love, I speak of their"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5027,Men of wit and fancy are often rakes; and fancy is the food of
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5028,"love.  Such men will inspire passion.  Half the sex, in its present"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5029,"infantine state, would pine for a Lovelace; a man so witty, so"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5030,"graceful, and so valiant; and can they DESERVE blame for acting"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5031,according to principles so constantly inculcated?  They want a

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5033,prostrate to beauty!  The virtues of a husband are thus thrown by
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5034,"love into the background, and gay hopes, or lively emotions, banish"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5035,reflection till the day of reckoning comes; and come it surely

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5039,habits.  When a man of abilities is first carried away by his
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5040,"passions, it is necessary that sentiment and taste varnish the"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5041,"enormities of vice, and give a zest to brutal indulgences: but when"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5042,"the gloss of novelty is worn off, and pleasure palls upon the"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5047,If much comfort cannot be expected from the friendship of a

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5050,hideous shape.  When the habits of weak people are consolidated by

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5052,beings miserable who have not sufficient mind to be amused by
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5053,innocent pleasure; like the tradesman who retires from the hurry of
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5054,"business, nature presents to them only a universal blank; and the"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5055,restless thoughts prey on the damped spirits.  Their reformation as

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5060,carefully ought we to guard the mind from storing up vicious
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5061,associations; and equally careful should we be to cultivate the

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,6,5063,of even harmless ignorance.  For it is the right use of reason

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,7,5089,"and should be distinguished from humility, because humility is a"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,7,5092,success gives it a sanction that determines its character.  Milton
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,7,5093,was not arrogant when he suffered a suggestion of judgment to
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,7,5094,escape him that proved a prophesy; nor was General Washington when

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,7,5096,always been characterized as a modest man; but had he been merely

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6409,There seems to be an indolent propensity in man to make

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6411,on an arbitrary foundation.  The rights of kings are deduced in a

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6416,thousand years ago--and not a jot more?  If parents discharge their
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6417,duty they have a strong hold and sacred claim on the gratitude of
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6418,their children; but few parents are willing to receive the
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6419,respectful affection of their offspring on such terms.  They demand
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6420,"blind obedience, because they do not merit a reasonable service:"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6421,"and to render these demands of weakness and ignorance more binding,"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6426,"naturally subsists between parent and child, may be given in a few"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6427,words:  The parent who pays proper attention to helpless infancy
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6428,has a right to require the same attention when the feebleness of
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6429,age comes upon him.  But to subjugate a rational being to the mere

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6565,which we inspire always resembles that we cultivate; so that
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6566,"natural affections, which have been supposed almost distinct from"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6567,"reason, may be found more nearly connected with judgment than is"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6568,"commonly allowed.  Nay, as another proof of the necessity of"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6569,"cultivating the female understanding, it is but just to observe,"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6570,that the affections seem to have a kind of animal capriciousness
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6571,when they merely reside in the heart.
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6572,It is the irregular exercise of parental authority that first
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6573,"injures the mind, and to these irregularities girls are more"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6574,subject than boys.  The will of those who never allow their will to

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6576,"relax proportionally, is almost always unreasonable.  To elude this"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6578,afterwards practise on their husbands; for I have frequently seen a
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6579,"little sharp-faced miss rule a whole family, excepting that now and"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6580,then mamma's anger will burst out of some accidental cloud-- either

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6582,"night before, than she was willing to own to her husband; or some"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6595,principle is to teach them to despise their parents.  Children
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6596,"cannot, ought not to be taught to make allowance for the faults of"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6597,"their parents, because every such allowance weakens the force of"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6598,"reason in their minds, and makes them still more indulgent to their"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6599,own.  It is one of the most sublime virtues of maturity that leads
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6600,"us to be severe with respect to ourselves, and forbearing to"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6602,if they begin too early to make allowance for human passions and
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6603,"manners, they wear off the fine edge of the criterion by which they"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6604,"should regulate their own, and become unjust in the same proportion"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6605,as they grow indulgent.
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,11,6606,"The affections of children, and weak people, are always selfish;"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,12,6616,ON NATIONAL EDUCATION.
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,12,6617,The good effects resulting from attention to private education will
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,12,6618,"ever be very confined, and the parent who really puts his own hand"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,12,6619,"to the plow, will always, in some degree be disappointed, till"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,12,6620,education becomes a grand national concern.  A man cannot retire
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,12,6621,"into a desert with his child, and if he did, he could not bring"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,12,6622,"himself back to childhood, and become the proper friend and"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,12,6623,play-fellow of an infant or youth.  And when children are confined
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,12,6624,"to the society of men and women, they very soon acquire that kind"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,12,6625,of premature manhood which stops the growth of every vigorous power
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,12,6626,of mind or body.  In order to open their faculties they should be
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,12,6627,excited to think for themselves; and this can only be done by
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,12,6628,"mixing a number of children together, and making them jointly"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,12,6629,pursue the same objects.
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,12,6630,"A child very soon contracts a benumbing indolence of mind, which he"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,12,6631,"has seldom sufficient vigour to shake off, when he only asks a"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,12,6632,"question instead of seeking for information, and then relies"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,12,6633,implicitly on the answer he receives.  With his equals in age this
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,12,6634,"could never be the case, and the subjects of inquiry, though they"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,12,6829,that thicken over the face of truth; but let more reason and virtue
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,12,6830,"prevail in society, and these strong winds would not be necessary."
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,12,6831,"Public education, of every denomination, should be directed to form"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,12,6833,exercise the affections of a son and a brother.  This is the only
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,12,6834,"way to expand the heart; for public affections, as well as public"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,12,6835,"virtues, must ever grow out of the private character, or they are"

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,12,6841,youthful sympathies forms the moral temperature; and it is the
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,12,6842,"recollection of these first affections and pursuits, that gives"
Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,12,6843,life to those that are afterwards more under the direction of

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,12,6856,would become better citizens by sacrificing the preparatory

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,12,6939,I have already animadverted on the bad habits which females acquire

Mary Wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,3420,12,6991,because they cannot enter into the minutiae of domestic taste;
