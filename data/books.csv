Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,9,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES ON THE E-TEXT:
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,10,"This E-text was prepared from the Pelican Classics edition of Leviathan,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,11,which in turn was prepared from the first edition. I have tried to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,12,"follow as closely as possible the original, and to give the flavour of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,13,"the text that Hobbes himself proof-read, but the following differences"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,14,were unavoidable.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,15,"Hobbes used capitals and italics very extensively, for emphasis, for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,16,"proper names, for quotations, and sometimes, it seems, just because."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,17,"The original has very extensive margin notes, which are used to show"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,18,"where he introduces the definitions of words and concepts, to give in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,19,"short the subject that a paragraph or section is dealing with, and to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,20,"give references to his quotations, largely but not exclusively biblical."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,21,"To some degree, these margin notes seem to have been intended to serve"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,22,"in place of an index, the original having none. They are all in italics."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,23,"He also used italics for words in other languages than English, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,24,"there are a number of Greek words, in the Greek alphabet, in the text."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,25,"To deal with these within the limits of plain vanilla ASCII, I have done"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,26,the following in this E-text.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,27,I have restricted my use of full capitalization to those places where
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,28,"Hobbes used it, except in the chapter headings, which I have fully"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,29,"capitalized, where Hobbes used a mixture of full capitalization and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,30,italics.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,31,"Where it is clear that the italics are to indicate the text is quoting,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,32,I have introduced quotation marks. Within quotation marks I have
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,33,retained the capitalization that Hobbes used.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,34,"Where italics seem to be used for emphasis, or for proper names, or just"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,35,"because, I have capitalized the initial letter of the words. This has"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,36,the disadvantage that they are not then distinguished from those that
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,37,"Hobbes capitalized in plain text, but the extent of his italics would"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,38,make the text very ugly if I was to use an underscore or slash.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,39,"Where the margin notes are either to introduce the paragraph subject,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,40,"or to show where he introduces word definitions, I have included them as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,41,"headers to the paragraph, again with all words having initial capitals,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,42,and on a shortened line.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,43,"For margin references to quotes, I have included them in the text,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,44,in brackets immediately next to the quotation. Where Hobbes included
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,45,"references in the main text, I have left them as he put them, except to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,46,change his square brackets to round.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,47,"For the Greek alphabet, I have simply substituted the nearest ordinary"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,48,"letters that I can, and I have used initial capitals for foreign"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,49,language words.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,50,Neither Thomas Hobbes nor his typesetters seem to have had many
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,51,inhibitions about spelling and punctuation. I have tried to reproduce
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,52,"both exactly, with the exception of the introduction of quotation marks."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,53,"In preparing the text, I have found that it has much more meaning if"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,54,"I read it with sub-vocalization, or aloud, rather than trying to read"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,55,silently. Hobbes' use of emphasis and his eccentric punctuation and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,56,construction seem then to work.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,57,TO MY MOST HONOR'D FRIEND Mr. FRANCIS GODOLPHIN of GODOLPHIN
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,58,HONOR'D SIR.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,59,"Your most worthy Brother Mr SIDNEY GODOLPHIN, when he lived, was pleas'd"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,60,"to think my studies something, and otherwise to oblige me, as you know,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,61,"with reall testimonies of his good opinion, great in themselves, and the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,62,greater for the worthinesse of his person. For there is not any vertue
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,63,"that disposeth a man, either to the service of God, or to the service"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,64,"of his Country, to Civill Society, or private Friendship, that did not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,65,"manifestly appear in his conversation, not as acquired by necessity,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,66,"or affected upon occasion, but inhaerent, and shining in a generous"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,67,"constitution of his nature. Therefore in honour and gratitude to him,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,68,"and with devotion to your selfe, I humbly Dedicate unto you this my"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,69,"discourse of Common-wealth. I know not how the world will receive it,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,70,nor how it may reflect on those that shall seem to favour it. For in a
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,71,"way beset with those that contend on one side for too great Liberty, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,72,"on the other side for too much Authority, 'tis hard to passe between the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,73,"points of both unwounded. But yet, me thinks, the endeavour to advance"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,74,"the Civill Power, should not be by the Civill Power condemned; nor"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,75,"private men, by reprehending it, declare they think that Power too"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,76,"great. Besides, I speak not of the men, but (in the Abstract) of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,77,"Seat of Power, (like to those simple and unpartiall creatures in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,78,"Roman Capitol, that with their noyse defended those within it, not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,79,"because they were they, but there) offending none, I think, but those"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,80,"without, or such within (if there be any such) as favour them. That"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,81,"which perhaps may most offend, are certain Texts of Holy Scripture,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,82,alledged by me to other purpose than ordinarily they use to be by
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,83,"others. But I have done it with due submission, and also (in order to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,84,"my Subject) necessarily; for they are the Outworks of the Enemy, from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,85,"whence they impugne the Civill Power. If notwithstanding this, you find"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,86,"my labour generally decryed, you may be pleased to excuse your selfe,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,87,"and say that I am a man that love my own opinions, and think all true I"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,88,"say, that I honoured your Brother, and honour you, and have presum'd on"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,89,"that, to assume the Title (without your knowledge) of being, as I am,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,90,"Sir,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,91,"Your most humble, and most obedient servant, Thomas Hobbes."

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,162,THE INTRODUCTION
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,163,Nature (the art whereby God hath made and governes the world) is by the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,164,"art of man, as in many other things, so in this also imitated, that it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,165,"can make an Artificial Animal. For seeing life is but a motion of Limbs,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,166,the begining whereof is in some principall part within; why may we not
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,167,"say, that all Automata (Engines that move themselves by springs and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,168,wheeles as doth a watch) have an artificiall life? For what is the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,169,"Heart, but a Spring; and the Nerves, but so many Strings; and the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,170,"Joynts, but so many Wheeles, giving motion to the whole Body, such as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,171,"was intended by the Artificer? Art goes yet further, imitating that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,172,"Rationall and most excellent worke of Nature, Man. For by Art is created"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,173,"that great LEVIATHAN called a COMMON-WEALTH, or STATE, (in latine"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,174,CIVITAS) which is but an Artificiall Man; though of greater stature
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,175,"and strength than the Naturall, for whose protection and defence it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,176,"was intended; and in which, the Soveraignty is an Artificiall Soul, as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,177,"giving life and motion to the whole body; The Magistrates, and other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,178,"Officers of Judicature and Execution, artificiall Joynts; Reward and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,179,"Punishment (by which fastned to the seat of the Soveraignty, every joynt"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,180,"and member is moved to performe his duty) are the Nerves, that do the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,181,same in the Body Naturall; The Wealth and Riches of all the particular
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,182,"members, are the Strength; Salus Populi (the Peoples Safety) its"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,183,"Businesse; Counsellors, by whom all things needfull for it to know,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,184,"are suggested unto it, are the Memory; Equity and Lawes, an artificiall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,185,"Reason and Will; Concord, Health; Sedition, Sicknesse; and Civill War,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,186,"Death. Lastly, the Pacts and Covenants, by which the parts of this Body"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,187,"Politique were at first made, set together, and united, resemble that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,188,"Fiat, or the Let Us Make Man, pronounced by God in the Creation."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,189,"To describe the Nature of this Artificiall man, I will consider"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,190,"First the Matter thereof, and the Artificer; both which is Man."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,191,"Secondly, How, and by what Covenants it is made; what are the Rights and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,192,just Power or Authority of a Soveraigne; and what it is that Preserveth
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,193,and Dissolveth it.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,194,"Thirdly, what is a Christian Common-Wealth."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,195,"Lastly, what is the Kingdome of Darkness."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,196,"Concerning the first, there is a saying much usurped of late, That"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,197,"Wisedome is acquired, not by reading of Books, but of Men. Consequently"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,198,"whereunto, those persons, that for the most part can give no other proof"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,199,"of being wise, take great delight to shew what they think they have read"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,200,"in men, by uncharitable censures of one another behind their backs."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,201,"But there is another saying not of late understood, by which they might"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,202,"learn truly to read one another, if they would take the pains; and that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,203,"is, Nosce Teipsum, Read Thy Self: which was not meant, as it is now"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,204,"used, to countenance, either the barbarous state of men in power,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,205,"towards their inferiors; or to encourage men of low degree, to a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,206,"sawcie behaviour towards their betters; But to teach us, that for the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,207,"similitude of the thoughts, and Passions of one man, to the thoughts,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,208,"and Passions of another, whosoever looketh into himselfe, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,209,"considereth what he doth, when he does Think, Opine, Reason, Hope,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,210,"Feare, &c, and upon what grounds; he shall thereby read and know,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,211,"what are the thoughts, and Passions of all other men, upon the like"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,212,"occasions. I say the similitude of Passions, which are the same in all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,213,"men, Desire, Feare, Hope, &c; not the similitude or The Objects of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,214,"Passions, which are the things Desired, Feared, Hoped, &c: for these the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,215,"constitution individuall, and particular education do so vary, and they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,216,"are so easie to be kept from our knowledge, that the characters of mans"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,217,"heart, blotted and confounded as they are, with dissembling, lying,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,218,"counterfeiting, and erroneous doctrines, are legible onely to him that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,219,searcheth hearts. And though by mens actions wee do discover their
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,220,"designee sometimes; yet to do it without comparing them with our own,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,221,"and distinguishing all circumstances, by which the case may come to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,222,"be altered, is to decypher without a key, and be for the most part"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,223,"deceived, by too much trust, or by too much diffidence; as he that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,224,"reads, is himselfe a good or evill man."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,225,"But let one man read another by his actions never so perfectly, it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,226,"serves him onely with his acquaintance, which are but few. He that is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,227,"to govern a whole Nation, must read in himselfe, not this, or that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,228,"particular man; but Man-kind; which though it be hard to do, harder than"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,229,"to learn any Language, or Science; yet, when I shall have set down my"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,230,"own reading orderly, and perspicuously, the pains left another, will be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,231,"onely to consider, if he also find not the same in himselfe. For this"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,232,"kind of Doctrine, admitteth no other Demonstration."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,0,233,PART 1 OF MAN
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,234,CHAPTER I. OF SENSE
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,235,"Concerning the Thoughts of man, I will consider them first Singly, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,236,"afterwards in Trayne, or dependance upon one another. Singly, they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,237,"are every one a Representation or Apparence, of some quality, or other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,238,Accident of a body without us; which is commonly called an Object. Which
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,239,"Object worketh on the Eyes, Eares, and other parts of mans body; and by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,240,"diversity of working, produceth diversity of Apparences."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,241,"The Originall of them all, is that which we call Sense; (For there is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,242,"no conception in a mans mind, which hath not at first, totally, or by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,243,"parts, been begotten upon the organs of Sense.) The rest are derived"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,244,from that originall.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,245,"To know the naturall cause of Sense, is not very necessary to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,246,business now in hand; and I have els-where written of the same at large.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,247,"Nevertheless, to fill each part of my present method, I will briefly"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,248,deliver the same in this place.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,249,"The cause of Sense, is the Externall Body, or Object, which presseth the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,250,"organ proper to each Sense, either immediatly, as in the Tast and Touch;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,251,"or mediately, as in Seeing, Hearing, and Smelling: which pressure, by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,252,"the mediation of Nerves, and other strings, and membranes of the body,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,253,"continued inwards to the Brain, and Heart, causeth there a resistance,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,254,"or counter-pressure, or endeavour of the heart, to deliver it self:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,255,"which endeavour because Outward, seemeth to be some matter without. And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,256,"this Seeming, or Fancy, is that which men call sense; and consisteth, as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,257,"to the Eye, in a Light, or Colour Figured; To the Eare, in a Sound; To"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,258,"the Nostrill, in an Odour; To the Tongue and Palat, in a Savour; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,259,"to the rest of the body, in Heat, Cold, Hardnesse, Softnesse, and such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,260,"other qualities, as we discern by Feeling. All which qualities called"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,261,"Sensible, are in the object that causeth them, but so many several"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,262,"motions of the matter, by which it presseth our organs diversly. Neither"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,263,"in us that are pressed, are they anything els, but divers motions; (for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,264,"motion, produceth nothing but motion.) But their apparence to us is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,265,"Fancy, the same waking, that dreaming. And as pressing, rubbing,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,266,"or striking the Eye, makes us fancy a light; and pressing the Eare,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,267,"produceth a dinne; so do the bodies also we see, or hear, produce the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,268,"same by their strong, though unobserved action, For if those Colours,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,269,"and Sounds, were in the Bodies, or Objects that cause them, they could"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,270,"not bee severed from them, as by glasses, and in Ecchoes by reflection,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,271,"wee see they are; where we know the thing we see, is in one place; the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,272,"apparence, in another. And though at some certain distance, the reall,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,273,and very object seem invested with the fancy it begets in us; Yet still
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,274,"the object is one thing, the image or fancy is another. So that Sense in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,275,"all cases, is nothing els but originall fancy, caused (as I have said)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,276,"by the pressure, that is, by the motion, of externall things upon our"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,277,"Eyes, Eares, and other organs thereunto ordained."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,278,"But the Philosophy-schooles, through all the Universities of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,279,"Christendome, grounded upon certain Texts of Aristotle, teach another"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,280,"doctrine; and say, For the cause of Vision, that the thing seen, sendeth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,281,"forth on every side a Visible Species(in English) a Visible Shew,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,282,"Apparition, or Aspect, or a Being Seen; the receiving whereof into the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,283,"Eye, is Seeing. And for the cause of Hearing, that the thing heard,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,284,"sendeth forth an Audible Species, that is, an Audible Aspect, or Audible"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,285,"Being Seen; which entring at the Eare, maketh Hearing. Nay for the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,286,"cause of Understanding also, they say the thing Understood sendeth forth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,287,"Intelligible Species, that is, an Intelligible Being Seen; which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,288,"comming into the Understanding, makes us Understand. I say not this,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,289,as disapproving the use of Universities: but because I am to speak
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,290,"hereafter of their office in a Common-wealth, I must let you see on"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,291,"all occasions by the way, what things would be amended in them; amongst"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,1,292,which the frequency of insignificant Speech is one.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,293,CHAPTER II. OF IMAGINATION
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,294,"That when a thing lies still, unlesse somewhat els stirre it, it will"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,295,"lye still for ever, is a truth that no man doubts of. But that when a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,296,"thing is in motion, it will eternally be in motion, unless somewhat els"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,297,"stay it, though the reason be the same, (namely, that nothing can change"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,298,"it selfe,) is not so easily assented to. For men measure, not onely"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,299,"other men, but all other things, by themselves: and because they find"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,300,"themselves subject after motion to pain, and lassitude, think every"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,301,"thing els growes weary of motion, and seeks repose of its own accord;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,302,"little considering, whether it be not some other motion, wherein that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,303,"desire of rest they find in themselves, consisteth. From hence it is,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,304,"that the Schooles say, Heavy bodies fall downwards, out of an appetite"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,305,"to rest, and to conserve their nature in that place which is most proper"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,306,"for them; ascribing appetite, and Knowledge of what is good for their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,307,"conservation, (which is more than man has) to things inanimate absurdly."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,308,"When a Body is once in motion, it moveth (unless something els hinder"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,309,"it) eternally; and whatsoever hindreth it, cannot in an instant, but in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,310,"time, and by degrees quite extinguish it: And as wee see in the water,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,311,"though the wind cease, the waves give not over rowling for a long"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,312,"time after; so also it happeneth in that motion, which is made in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,313,"internall parts of a man, then, when he Sees, Dreams, &c. For after the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,314,"object is removed, or the eye shut, wee still retain an image of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,315,"thing seen, though more obscure than when we see it. And this is it,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,316,"that Latines call Imagination, from the image made in seeing; and apply"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,317,"the same, though improperly, to all the other senses. But the Greeks"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,318,"call it Fancy; which signifies Apparence, and is as proper to one sense,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,319,as to another. Imagination therefore is nothing but Decaying Sense; and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,320,"is found in men, and many other living Creatures, as well sleeping, as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,321,waking.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,322,Memory
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,323,"The decay of Sense in men waking, is not the decay of the motion made in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,324,"sense; but an obscuring of it, in such manner, as the light of the Sun"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,325,obscureth the light of the Starres; which starrs do no less exercise
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,326,"their vertue by which they are visible, in the day, than in the night."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,327,"But because amongst many stroaks, which our eyes, eares, and other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,328,"organs receive from externall bodies, the predominant onely is sensible;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,329,"therefore the light of the Sun being predominant, we are not affected"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,330,with the action of the starrs. And any object being removed from our
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,331,"eyes, though the impression it made in us remain; yet other objects more"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,332,"present succeeding, and working on us, the Imagination of the past is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,333,"obscured, and made weak; as the voyce of a man is in the noyse of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,334,"day. From whence it followeth, that the longer the time is, after the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,335,"sight, or Sense of any object, the weaker is the Imagination. For the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,336,"continuall change of mans body, destroyes in time the parts which in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,337,"sense were moved: So that the distance of time, and of place, hath one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,338,"and the same effect in us. For as at a distance of place, that which wee"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,339,"look at, appears dimme, and without distinction of the smaller parts;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,340,"and as Voyces grow weak, and inarticulate: so also after great distance"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,341,"of time, our imagination of the Past is weak; and wee lose( for example)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,342,"of Cities wee have seen, many particular Streets; and of Actions, many"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,343,"particular Circumstances. This Decaying Sense, when wee would express"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,344,"the thing it self, (I mean Fancy it selfe,) wee call Imagination, as I"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,345,"said before; But when we would express the Decay, and signifie that the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,346,"Sense is fading, old, and past, it is called Memory. So that Imagination"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,347,"and Memory, are but one thing, which for divers considerations hath"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,348,divers names.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,349,"Much memory, or memory of many things, is called Experience. Againe,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,350,Imagination being only of those things which have been formerly
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,351,"perceived by Sense, either all at once, or by parts at severall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,352,"times; The former, (which is the imagining the whole object, as it was"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,353,presented to the sense) is Simple Imagination; as when one imagineth a
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,354,"man, or horse, which he hath seen before. The other is Compounded; as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,355,"when from the sight of a man at one time, and of a horse at another, we"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,356,conceive in our mind a Centaure. So when a man compoundeth the image of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,357,"his own person, with the image of the actions of an other man; as when a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,358,"man imagins himselfe a Hercules, or an Alexander, (which happeneth often"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,359,to them that are much taken with reading of Romants) it is a compound
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,360,"imagination, and properly but a Fiction of the mind. There be also other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,361,"Imaginations that rise in men, (though waking) from the great impression"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,362,"made in sense; As from gazing upon the Sun, the impression leaves an"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,363,image of the Sun before our eyes a long time after; and from being long
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,364,"and vehemently attent upon Geometricall Figures, a man shall in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,365,"dark, (though awake) have the Images of Lines, and Angles before his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,366,eyes: which kind of Fancy hath no particular name; as being a thing that
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,367,doth not commonly fall into mens discourse.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,368,Dreams
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,369,"The imaginations of them that sleep, are those we call Dreams. And these"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,370,"also (as all other Imaginations) have been before, either totally, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,371,"by parcells in the Sense. And because in sense, the Brain, and Nerves,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,372,"which are the necessary Organs of sense, are so benummed in sleep, as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,373,"not easily to be moved by the action of Externall Objects, there can"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,374,"happen in sleep, no Imagination; and therefore no Dreame, but what"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,375,proceeds from the agitation of the inward parts of mans body; which
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,376,"inward parts, for the connexion they have with the Brayn, and other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,377,"Organs, when they be distempered, do keep the same in motion; whereby"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,378,"the Imaginations there formerly made, appeare as if a man were waking;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,379,"saving that the Organs of Sense being now benummed, so as there is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,380,"no new object, which can master and obscure them with a more vigorous"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,381,"impression, a Dreame must needs be more cleare, in this silence of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,382,"sense, than are our waking thoughts. And hence it cometh to pass, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,383,"it is a hard matter, and by many thought impossible to distinguish"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,384,"exactly between Sense and Dreaming. For my part, when I consider, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,385,"in Dreames, I do not often, nor constantly think of the same Persons,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,386,"Places, Objects, and Actions that I do waking; nor remember so long a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,387,"trayne of coherent thoughts, Dreaming, as at other times; And because"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,388,"waking I often observe the absurdity of Dreames, but never dream of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,389,"the absurdities of my waking Thoughts; I am well satisfied, that being"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,390,"awake, I know I dreame not; though when I dreame, I think my selfe"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,391,awake.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,392,And seeing dreames are caused by the distemper of some of the inward
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,393,parts of the Body; divers distempers must needs cause different Dreams.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,394,"And hence it is, that lying cold breedeth Dreams of Feare, and raiseth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,395,the thought and Image of some fearfull object (the motion from the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,396,"brain to the inner parts, and from the inner parts to the Brain being"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,397,"reciprocall:) and that as Anger causeth heat in some parts of the Body,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,398,"when we are awake; so when we sleep, the over heating of the same parts"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,399,"causeth Anger, and raiseth up in the brain the Imagination of an Enemy."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,400,"In the same manner; as naturall kindness, when we are awake causeth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,401,desire; and desire makes heat in certain other parts of the body; so
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,402,"also, too much heat in those parts, while wee sleep, raiseth in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,403,"brain an imagination of some kindness shewn. In summe, our Dreams are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,404,"the reverse of our waking Imaginations; The motion when we are awake,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,405,"beginning at one end; and when we Dream, at another."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,406,Apparitions Or Visions
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,407,"The most difficult discerning of a mans Dream, from his waking thoughts,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,408,"is then, when by some accident we observe not that we have slept:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,409,which is easie to happen to a man full of fearfull thoughts; and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,410,"whose conscience is much troubled; and that sleepeth, without the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,411,"circumstances, of going to bed, or putting off his clothes, as one that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,412,"noddeth in a chayre. For he that taketh pains, and industriously layes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,413,"himselfe to sleep, in case any uncouth and exorbitant fancy come unto"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,414,"him, cannot easily think it other than a Dream. We read of Marcus"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,415,"Brutes, (one that had his life given him by Julius Caesar, and was also"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,416,"his favorite, and notwithstanding murthered him,) how at Phillipi,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,417,"the night before he gave battell to Augustus Caesar, he saw a fearfull"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,418,"apparition, which is commonly related by Historians as a Vision: but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,419,"considering the circumstances, one may easily judge to have been but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,420,"a short Dream. For sitting in his tent, pensive and troubled with the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,421,"horrour of his rash act, it was not hard for him, slumbering in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,422,"cold, to dream of that which most affrighted him; which feare, as by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,423,degrees it made him wake; so also it must needs make the Apparition by
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,424,"degrees to vanish: And having no assurance that he slept, he could have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,425,"no cause to think it a Dream, or any thing but a Vision. And this is no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,426,"very rare Accident: for even they that be perfectly awake, if they be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,427,"timorous, and supperstitious, possessed with fearfull tales, and alone"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,428,"in the dark, are subject to the like fancies, and believe they see"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,429,spirits and dead mens Ghosts walking in Churchyards; whereas it is
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,430,"either their Fancy onely, or els the knavery of such persons, as make"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,431,"use of such superstitious feare, to pass disguised in the night, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,432,places they would not be known to haunt.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,433,"From this ignorance of how to distinguish Dreams, and other strong"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,434,"Fancies, from vision and Sense, did arise the greatest part of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,435,"Religion of the Gentiles in time past, that worshipped Satyres, Fawnes,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,436,"nymphs, and the like; and now adayes the opinion than rude people have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,437,"of Fayries, Ghosts, and Goblins; and of the power of Witches. For as for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,438,"Witches, I think not that their witch craft is any reall power; but yet"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,439,"that they are justly punished, for the false beliefe they have, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,440,"they can do such mischiefe, joyned with their purpose to do it if they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,441,"can; their trade being neerer to a new Religion, than to a Craft or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,442,"Science. And for Fayries, and walking Ghosts, the opinion of them has I"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,443,"think been on purpose, either taught, or not confuted, to keep in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,444,"credit the use of Exorcisme, of Crosses, of holy Water, and other such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,445,"inventions of Ghostly men. Neverthelesse, there is no doubt, but God can"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,446,"make unnaturall Apparitions. But that he does it so often, as men need"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,447,"to feare such things, more than they feare the stay, or change, of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,448,"course of Nature, which he also can stay, and change, is no point of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,449,"Christian faith. But evill men under pretext that God can do any thing,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,450,"are so bold as to say any thing when it serves their turn, though"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,451,"they think it untrue; It is the part of a wise man, to believe them no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,452,"further, than right reason makes that which they say, appear credible."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,453,"If this superstitious fear of Spirits were taken away, and with it,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,454,"Prognostiques from Dreams, false Prophecies, and many other things"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,455,"depending thereon, by which, crafty ambitious persons abuse the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,456,"simple people, men would be much more fitted than they are for civill"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,457,Obedience.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,458,And this ought to be the work of the Schooles; but they rather nourish
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,459,"such doctrine. For (not knowing what Imagination, or the Senses are),"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,460,"what they receive, they teach: some saying, that Imaginations rise of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,461,"themselves, and have no cause: Others that they rise most commonly from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,462,"the Will; and that Good thoughts are blown (inspired) into a man, by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,463,God; and evill thoughts by the Divell: or that Good thoughts are powred
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,464,"(infused) into a man, by God; and evill ones by the Divell. Some say"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,465,"the Senses receive the Species of things, and deliver them to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,466,"Common-sense; and the Common Sense delivers them over to the Fancy, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,467,"the Fancy to the Memory, and the Memory to the Judgement, like"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,468,"handing of things from one to another, with many words making nothing"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,469,understood.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,470,Understanding
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,471,The Imagination that is raysed in man (or any other creature indued with
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,472,"the faculty of imagining) by words, or other voluntary signes, is that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,473,we generally call Understanding; and is common to Man and Beast. For a
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,474,"dogge by custome will understand the call, or the rating of his Master;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,475,and so will many other Beasts. That Understanding which is peculiar to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,476,"man, is the Understanding not onely his will; but his conceptions and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,477,"thoughts, by the sequell and contexture of the names of things into"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,478,"Affirmations, Negations, and other formes of Speech: And of this kinde"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,2,479,of Understanding I shall speak hereafter.

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,484,"When a man thinketh on any thing whatsoever, His next Thought after, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,485,not altogether so casuall as it seems to be. Not every Thought to every
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,486,"Thought succeeds indifferently. But as wee have no Imagination, whereof"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,487,"we have not formerly had Sense, in whole, or in parts; so we have no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,488,"Transition from one Imagination to another, whereof we never had the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,489,like before in our Senses. The reason whereof is this. All Fancies
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,490,"are Motions within us, reliques of those made in the Sense: And those"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,491,"motions that immediately succeeded one another in the sense, continue"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,492,also together after Sense: In so much as the former comming again to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,493,"take place, and be praedominant, the later followeth, by coherence of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,494,"the matter moved, is such manner, as water upon a plain Table is drawn"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,495,which way any one part of it is guided by the finger. But because
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,496,"in sense, to one and the same thing perceived, sometimes one thing,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,497,"sometimes another succeedeth, it comes to passe in time, that in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,498,"Imagining of any thing, there is no certainty what we shall Imagine"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,499,"next; Onely this is certain, it shall be something that succeeded the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,500,"same before, at one time or another."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,501,Trayne Of Thoughts Unguided
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,502,"This Trayne of Thoughts, or Mentall Discourse, is of two sorts. The"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,503,"first is Unguided, Without Designee, and inconstant; Wherein there is no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,504,"Passionate Thought, to govern and direct those that follow, to it self,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,505,"as the end and scope of some desire, or other passion: In which case the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,506,"thoughts are said to wander, and seem impertinent one to another, as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,507,"in a Dream. Such are Commonly the thoughts of men, that are not onely"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,508,"without company, but also without care of any thing; though even then"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,509,"their Thoughts are as busie as at other times, but without harmony; as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,510,"the sound which a Lute out of tune would yeeld to any man; or in tune,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,511,"to one that could not play. And yet in this wild ranging of the mind,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,512,"a man may oft-times perceive the way of it, and the dependance of one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,513,"thought upon another. For in a Discourse of our present civill warre,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,514,"what could seem more impertinent, than to ask (as one did) what was the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,515,value of a Roman Penny? Yet the Cohaerence to me was manifest enough.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,516,"For the Thought of the warre, introduced the Thought of the delivering"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,517,"up the King to his Enemies; The Thought of that, brought in the Thought"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,518,of the delivering up of Christ; and that again the Thought of the 30
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,519,"pence, which was the price of that treason: and thence easily followed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,520,that malicious question; and all this in a moment of time; for Thought
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,521,is quick.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,522,Trayne Of Thoughts Regulated
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,523,"The second is more constant; as being Regulated by some desire, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,524,"designee. For the impression made by such things as wee desire, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,525,"feare, is strong, and permanent, or, (if it cease for a time,) of quick"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,526,"return: so strong it is sometimes, as to hinder and break our sleep."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,527,"From Desire, ariseth the Thought of some means we have seen produce the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,528,"like of that which we ayme at; and from the thought of that, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,529,"thought of means to that mean; and so continually, till we come to some"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,530,"beginning within our own power. And because the End, by the greatnesse"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,531,"of the impression, comes often to mind, in case our thoughts begin to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,532,"wander, they are quickly again reduced into the way: which observed by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,533,"one of the seven wise men, made him give men this praecept, which is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,534,"now worne out, Respice Finem; that is to say, in all your actions,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,535,"look often upon what you would have, as the thing that directs all your"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,536,thoughts in the way to attain it.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,537,Remembrance
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,538,"The Trayn of regulated Thoughts is of two kinds; One, when of an effect"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,539,"imagined, wee seek the causes, or means that produce it: and this"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,540,"is common to Man and Beast. The other is, when imagining any thing"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,541,"whatsoever, wee seek all the possible effects, that can by it be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,542,"produced; that is to say, we imagine what we can do with it, when wee"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,543,"have it. Of which I have not at any time seen any signe, but in man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,544,onely; for this is a curiosity hardly incident to the nature of any
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,545,"living creature that has no other Passion but sensuall, such as are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,546,"hunger, thirst, lust, and anger. In summe, the Discourse of the Mind,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,547,"when it is governed by designee, is nothing but Seeking, or the faculty"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,548,"of Invention, which the Latines call Sagacitas, and Solertia; a hunting"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,549,"out of the causes, of some effect, present or past; or of the effects,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,550,"of some present or past cause, sometimes a man seeks what he hath lost;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,551,"and from that place, and time, wherein hee misses it, his mind runs"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,552,"back, from place to place, and time to time, to find where, and when"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,553,"he had it; that is to say, to find some certain, and limited time and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,554,"place, in which to begin a method of seeking. Again, from thence, his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,555,"thoughts run over the same places and times, to find what action, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,556,"other occasion might make him lose it. This we call Remembrance,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,557,"or Calling to mind: the Latines call it Reminiscentia, as it were a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,558,Re-Conning of our former actions.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,559,"Sometimes a man knows a place determinate, within the compasse whereof"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,560,"his is to seek; and then his thoughts run over all the parts thereof,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,561,"in the same manner, as one would sweep a room, to find a jewell; or as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,562,"a Spaniel ranges the field, till he find a sent; or as a man should run"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,563,"over the alphabet, to start a rime."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,564,Prudence
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,565,Sometime a man desires to know the event of an action; and then he
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,566,"thinketh of some like action past, and the events thereof one after"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,567,another; supposing like events will follow like actions. As he that
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,568,"foresees what wil become of a Criminal, re-cons what he has seen follow"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,569,"on the like Crime before; having this order of thoughts, The Crime,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,570,"the Officer, the Prison, the Judge, and the Gallowes. Which kind"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,571,"of thoughts, is called Foresight, and Prudence, or Providence; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,572,"sometimes Wisdome; though such conjecture, through the difficulty of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,573,"observing all circumstances, be very fallacious. But this is certain; by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,574,"how much one man has more experience of things past, than another; by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,575,"so much also he is more Prudent, and his expectations the seldomer faile"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,576,him. The Present onely has a being in Nature; things Past have a being
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,577,"in the Memory onely, but things To Come have no being at all; the Future"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,578,"being but a fiction of the mind, applying the sequels of actions Past,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,579,to the actions that are Present; which with most certainty is done by
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,580,him that has most Experience; but not with certainty enough. And though
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,581,"it be called Prudence, when the Event answereth our Expectation; yet in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,582,"its own nature, it is but Presumption. For the foresight of things to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,583,"come, which is Providence, belongs onely to him by whose will they are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,584,"to come. From him onely, and supernaturally, proceeds Prophecy. The best"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,585,"Prophet naturally is the best guesser; and the best guesser, he that is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,586,most versed and studied in the matters he guesses at: for he hath most
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,587,Signes to guesse by.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,588,Signes
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,589,"A Signe, is the Event Antecedent, of the Consequent; and contrarily,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,590,"the Consequent of the Antecedent, when the like Consequences have been"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,591,"observed, before: And the oftner they have been observed, the lesse"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,592,uncertain is the Signe. And therefore he that has most experience in
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,593,"any kind of businesse, has most Signes, whereby to guesse at the Future"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,594,"time, and consequently is the most prudent: And so much more prudent"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,595,"than he that is new in that kind of business, as not to be equalled by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,596,any advantage of naturall and extemporary wit: though perhaps many young
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,597,men think the contrary.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,598,Neverthelesse it is not Prudence that distinguisheth man from beast.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,599,"There be beasts, that at a year old observe more, and pursue that which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,600,"is for their good, more prudently, than a child can do at ten."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,601,Conjecture Of The Time Past
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,602,"As Prudence is a Praesumtion of the Future, contracted from the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,603,Experience of time Past; So there is a Praesumtion of things Past taken
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,604,from other things (not future but) past also. For he that hath seen
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,605,"by what courses and degrees, a flourishing State hath first come into"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,606,"civill warre, and then to ruine; upon the sights of the ruines of any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,607,"other State, will guesse, the like warre, and the like courses have been"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,608,"there also. But his conjecture, has the same incertainty almost with the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,609,conjecture of the Future; both being grounded onely upon Experience.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,610,"There is no other act of mans mind, that I can remember, naturally"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,611,"planted in him, so, as to need no other thing, to the exercise of it,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,612,"but to be born a man, and live with the use of his five Senses. Those"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,613,"other Faculties, of which I shall speak by and by, and which seem proper"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,614,"to man onely, are acquired, and encreased by study and industry; and of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,615,"most men learned by instruction, and discipline; and proceed all from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,616,"the invention of Words, and Speech. For besides Sense, and Thoughts, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,617,"the Trayne of thoughts, the mind of man has no other motion; though by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,618,"the help of Speech, and Method, the same Facultyes may be improved to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,619,"such a height, as to distinguish men from all other living Creatures."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,620,"Whatsoever we imagine, is Finite. Therefore there is no Idea, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,621,conception of anything we call Infinite. No man can have in his mind an
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,622,"Image of infinite magnitude; nor conceive the ends, and bounds of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,623,"the thing named; having no Conception of the thing, but of our own"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,624,"inability. And therefore the Name of GOD is used, not to make us"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,625,"conceive him; (for he is Incomprehensible; and his greatnesse, and power"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,626,are unconceivable;) but that we may honour him. Also because whatsoever
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,627,"(as I said before,) we conceive, has been perceived first by sense,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,628,"either all at once, or by parts; a man can have no thought, representing"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,629,"any thing, not subject to sense. No man therefore can conceive any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,630,"thing, but he must conceive it in some place; and indued with some"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,631,determinate magnitude; and which may be divided into parts; nor that any
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,632,"thing is all in this place, and all in another place at the same time;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,633,"nor that two, or more things can be in one, and the same place at once:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,634,"for none of these things ever have, or can be incident to Sense; but are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,635,"absurd speeches, taken upon credit (without any signification at all,)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,3,636,"from deceived Philosophers, and deceived, or deceiving Schoolemen."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,637,CHAPTER IV. OF SPEECH
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,638,Originall Of Speech
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,639,"The Invention of Printing, though ingenious, compared with the invention"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,640,"of Letters, is no great matter. But who was the first that found the use"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,641,"of Letters, is not known. He that first brought them into Greece, men"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,642,"say was Cadmus, the sonne of Agenor, King of Phaenicia. A profitable"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,643,"Invention for continuing the memory of time past, and the conjunction of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,644,"mankind, dispersed into so many, and distant regions of the Earth; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,645,"with all difficult, as proceeding from a watchfull observation of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,646,"divers motions of the Tongue, Palat, Lips, and other organs of Speech;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,647,"whereby to make as many differences of characters, to remember them."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,648,"But the most noble and profitable invention of all other, was that of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,649,"Speech, consisting of Names or Apellations, and their Connexion; whereby"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,650,men register their Thoughts; recall them when they are past; and also
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,651,declare them one to another for mutuall utility and conversation;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,652,"without which, there had been amongst men, neither Common-wealth, nor"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,653,"Society, nor Contract, nor Peace, no more than amongst Lyons, Bears,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,654,"and Wolves. The first author of Speech was GOD himselfe, that instructed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,655,Adam how to name such creatures as he presented to his sight; For the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,656,Scripture goeth no further in this matter. But this was sufficient
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,657,"to direct him to adde more names, as the experience and use of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,658,creatures should give him occasion; and to joyn them in such manner by
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,659,"degrees, as to make himselfe understood; and so by succession of time,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,660,"so much language might be gotten, as he had found use for; though not so"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,661,"copious, as an Orator or Philosopher has need of. For I do not find any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,662,"thing in the Scripture, out of which, directly or by consequence can"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,663,"be gathered, that Adam was taught the names of all Figures, Numbers,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,664,"Measures, Colours, Sounds, Fancies, Relations; much less the names"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,665,"of Words and Speech, as Generall, Speciall, Affirmative, Negative,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,666,"Interrogative, Optative, Infinitive, all which are usefull; and least of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,667,"all, of Entity, Intentionality, Quiddity, and other significant words of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,668,the School.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,669,"But all this language gotten, and augmented by Adam and his posterity,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,670,"was again lost at the tower of Babel, when by the hand of God, every man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,671,"was stricken for his rebellion, with an oblivion of his former language."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,672,And being hereby forced to disperse themselves into severall parts of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,673,"the world, it must needs be, that the diversity of Tongues that now is,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,674,"proceeded by degrees from them, in such manner, as need (the mother of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,675,all inventions) taught them; and in tract of time grew every where more
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,676,copious.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,677,The Use Of Speech
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,678,"The generall use of Speech, is to transferre our Mentall Discourse, into"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,679,"Verbal; or the Trayne of our Thoughts, into a Trayne of Words; and that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,680,"for two commodities; whereof one is, the Registring of the Consequences"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,681,"of our Thoughts; which being apt to slip out of our memory, and put"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,682,"us to a new labour, may again be recalled, by such words as they were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,683,"marked by. So that the first use of names, is to serve for Markes,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,684,"or Notes of remembrance. Another is, when many use the same words,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,685,"to signifie (by their connexion and order,) one to another, what they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,686,"conceive, or think of each matter; and also what they desire, feare,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,687,"or have any other passion for, and for this use they are called"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,688,"Signes. Speciall uses of Speech are these; First, to Register, what by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,689,"cogitation, wee find to be the cause of any thing, present or past; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,690,"what we find things present or past may produce, or effect: which in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,691,"summe, is acquiring of Arts. Secondly, to shew to others that knowledge"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,692,"which we have attained; which is, to Counsell, and Teach one another."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,693,"Thirdly, to make known to others our wills, and purposes, that we may"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,694,"have the mutuall help of one another. Fourthly, to please and delight"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,695,"our selves, and others, by playing with our words, for pleasure or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,696,"ornament, innocently."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,697,Abuses Of Speech
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,698,"To these Uses, there are also foure correspondent Abuses. First,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,699,"when men register their thoughts wrong, by the inconstancy of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,700,signification of their words; by which they register for their
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,701,"conceptions, that which they never conceived; and so deceive themselves."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,702,"Secondly, when they use words metaphorically; that is, in other sense"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,703,"than that they are ordained for; and thereby deceive others. Thirdly,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,704,"when by words they declare that to be their will, which is not."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,705,"Fourthly, when they use them to grieve one another: for seeing nature"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,706,"hath armed living creatures, some with teeth, some with horns, and some"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,707,"with hands, to grieve an enemy, it is but an abuse of Speech, to grieve"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,708,"him with the tongue, unlesse it be one whom wee are obliged to govern;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,709,"and then it is not to grieve, but to correct and amend."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,710,The manner how Speech serveth to the remembrance of the consequence
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,711,"of causes and effects, consisteth in the imposing of Names, and the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,712,Connexion of them.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,713,Names Proper & Common Universall
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,714,"Of Names, some are Proper, and singular to one onely thing; as Peter,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,715,"John, This Man, This Tree: and some are Common to many things; as Man,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,716,"Horse, Tree; every of which though but one Name, is nevertheless the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,717,"name of divers particular things; in respect of all which together, it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,718,is called an Universall; there being nothing in the world Universall
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,719,"but Names; for the things named, are every one of them Individual and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,720,Singular.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,721,"One Universall name is imposed on many things, for their similitude in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,722,"some quality, or other accident: And whereas a Proper Name bringeth to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,723,mind one thing onely; Universals recall any one of those many.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,724,"And of Names Universall, some are of more, and some of lesse extent; the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,725,"larger comprehending the lesse large: and some again of equall extent,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,726,"comprehending each other reciprocally. As for example, the Name Body is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,727,"of larger signification than the word Man, and conprehendeth it; and the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,728,"names Man and Rationall, are of equall extent, comprehending mutually"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,729,"one another. But here wee must take notice, that by a Name is not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,730,"alwayes understood, as in Grammar, one onely word; but sometimes by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,731,"circumlocution many words together. For all these words, Hee That In"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,732,"His Actions Observeth The Lawes Of His Country, make but one Name,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,733,"equivalent to this one word, Just."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,734,"By this imposition of Names, some of larger, some of stricter"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,735,"signification, we turn the reckoning of the consequences of things"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,736,"imagined in the mind, into a reckoning of the consequences of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,737,"Appellations. For example, a man that hath no use of Speech at all,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,738,"(such, as is born and remains perfectly deafe and dumb,) if he set"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,739,"before his eyes a triangle, and by it two right angles, (such as are the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,740,"corners of a square figure,) he may by meditation compare and find, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,741,"the three angles of that triangle, are equall to those two right angles"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,742,that stand by it. But if another triangle be shewn him different in
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,743,"shape from the former, he cannot know without a new labour, whether the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,744,three angles of that also be equall to the same. But he that hath the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,745,"use of words, when he observes, that such equality was consequent, not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,746,"to the length of the sides, nor to any other particular thing in his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,747,"triangle; but onely to this, that the sides were straight, and the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,748,"angles three; and that that was all, for which he named it a Triangle;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,749,"will boldly conclude Universally, that such equality of angles is in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,750,all triangles whatsoever; and register his invention in these generall
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,751,"termes, Every Triangle Hath Its Three Angles Equall To Two Right Angles."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,752,"And thus the consequence found in one particular, comes to be registred"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,753,"and remembred, as a Universall rule; and discharges our mentall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,754,"reckoning, of time and place; and delivers us from all labour of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,755,"mind, saving the first; and makes that which was found true Here, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,756,"Now, to be true in All Times and Places."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,757,"But the use of words in registring our thoughts, is in nothing so"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,758,evident as in Numbering. A naturall foole that could never learn by
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,759,"heart the order of numerall words, as One, Two, and Three, may observe"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,760,"every stroak of the Clock, and nod to it, or say one, one, one; but can"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,761,"never know what houre it strikes. And it seems, there was a time when"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,762,those names of number were not in use; and men were fayn to apply their
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,763,"fingers of one or both hands, to those things they desired to keep"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,764,"account of; and that thence it proceeded, that now our numerall words"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,765,"are but ten, in any Nation, and in some but five, and then they begin"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,766,"again. And he that can tell ten, if he recite them out of order, will"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,767,"lose himselfe, and not know when he has done: Much lesse will he be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,768,"able to add, and substract, and performe all other operations of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,769,"Arithmetique. So that without words, there is no possibility of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,770,"reckoning of Numbers; much lesse of Magnitudes, of Swiftnesse, of Force,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,771,"and other things, the reckonings whereof are necessary to the being, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,772,well-being of man-kind.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,773,"When two Names are joyned together into a Consequence, or Affirmation;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,774,"as thus, A Man Is A Living Creature; or thus, If He Be A Man, He Is A"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,775,"Living Creature, If the later name Living Creature, signifie all that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,776,"the former name Man signifieth, then the affirmation, or consequence is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,777,"True; otherwise False. For True and False are attributes of Speech, not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,778,"of things. And where Speech in not, there is neither Truth nor Falshood."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,779,"Errour there may be, as when wee expect that which shall not be; or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,780,suspect what has not been: but in neither case can a man be charged with
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,781,Untruth.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,782,Seeing then that Truth consisteth in the right ordering of names in our
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,783,"affirmations, a man that seeketh precise Truth, had need to remember"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,784,what every name he uses stands for; and to place it accordingly; or els
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,785,"he will find himselfe entangled in words, as a bird in lime-twiggs; the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,786,"more he struggles, the more belimed. And therefore in Geometry, (which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,787,is the onely Science that it hath pleased God hitherto to bestow on
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,788,"mankind,) men begin at settling the significations of their words; which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,789,"settling of significations, they call Definitions; and place them in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,790,beginning of their reckoning.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,791,By this it appears how necessary it is for any man that aspires to true
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,792,"Knowledge, to examine the Definitions of former Authors; and either"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,793,"to correct them, where they are negligently set down; or to make them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,794,"himselfe. For the errours of Definitions multiply themselves, according"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,795,"as the reckoning proceeds; and lead men into absurdities, which at last"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,796,"they see, but cannot avoyd, without reckoning anew from the beginning;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,797,"in which lyes the foundation of their errours. From whence it happens,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,798,"that they which trust to books, do as they that cast up many little"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,799,"summs into a greater, without considering whether those little summes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,800,"were rightly cast up or not; and at last finding the errour visible,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,801,"and not mistrusting their first grounds, know not which way to cleere"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,802,themselves; but spend time in fluttering over their bookes; as birds
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,803,"that entring by the chimney, and finding themselves inclosed in a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,804,"chamber, flitter at the false light of a glasse window, for want of wit"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,805,to consider which way they came in. So that in the right Definition
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,806,"of Names, lyes the first use of Speech; which is the Acquisition of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,807,"Science: And in wrong, or no Definitions' lyes the first abuse; from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,808,which proceed all false and senslesse Tenets; which make those men that
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,809,"take their instruction from the authority of books, and not from their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,810,"own meditation, to be as much below the condition of ignorant men, as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,811,"men endued with true Science are above it. For between true Science,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,812,"and erroneous Doctrines, Ignorance is in the middle. Naturall sense and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,813,"imagination, are not subject to absurdity. Nature it selfe cannot erre:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,814,"and as men abound in copiousnesse of language; so they become more wise,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,815,or more mad than ordinary. Nor is it possible without Letters for any
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,816,"man to become either excellently wise, or (unless his memory be hurt by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,817,"disease, or ill constitution of organs) excellently foolish. For words"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,818,"are wise mens counters, they do but reckon by them: but they are the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,819,"mony of fooles, that value them by the authority of an Aristotle, a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,820,"Cicero, or a Thomas, or any other Doctor whatsoever, if but a man."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,821,Subject To Names
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,822,"Subject To Names, is whatsoever can enter into, or be considered in an"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,823,account; and be added one to another to make a summe; or substracted one
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,824,"from another, and leave a remainder. The Latines called Accounts of mony"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,825,"Rationes, and accounting, Ratiocinatio: and that which we in bills or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,826,"books of account call Items, they called Nomina; that is, Names: and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,827,"thence it seems to proceed, that they extended the word Ratio, to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,828,faculty of Reckoning in all other things. The Greeks have but one word
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,829,"Logos, for both Speech and Reason; not that they thought there was no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,830,Speech without Reason; but no Reasoning without Speech: And the act of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,831,reasoning they called syllogisme; which signifieth summing up of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,832,consequences of one saying to another. And because the same things may
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,833,enter into account for divers accidents; their names are (to shew that
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,834,"diversity) diversly wrested, and diversified. This diversity of names"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,835,may be reduced to foure generall heads.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,836,"First, a thing may enter into account for Matter, or Body; as Living,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,837,"Sensible, Rationall, Hot, Cold, Moved, Quiet; with all which names the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,838,"word Matter, or Body is understood; all such, being names of Matter."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,839,"Secondly, it may enter into account, or be considered, for some accident"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,840,"or quality, which we conceive to be in it; as for Being Moved, for Being"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,841,"So Long, for Being Hot, &c; and then, of the name of the thing it selfe,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,842,"by a little change or wresting, wee make a name for that accident, which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,843,"we consider; and for Living put into account Life; for Moved, Motion;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,844,"for Hot, Heat; for Long, Length, and the like. And all such Names, are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,845,"the names of the accidents and properties, by which one Matter, and Body"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,846,is distinguished from another. These are called Names Abstract; Because
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,847,"Severed (not from Matter, but) from the account of Matter."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,848,"Thirdly, we bring into account, the Properties of our own bodies,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,849,"whereby we make such distinction: as when any thing is Seen by us, we"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,850,"reckon not the thing it selfe; but the Sight, the Colour, the Idea of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,851,"it in the fancy: and when any thing is Heard, wee reckon it not; but the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,852,"Hearing, or Sound onely, which is our fancy or conception of it by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,853,Eare: and such are names of fancies.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,854,"Fourthly, we bring into account, consider, and give names, to Names"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,855,"themselves, and to Speeches: For, Generall, Universall, Speciall,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,856,"Oequivocall, are names of Names. And Affirmation, Interrogation,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,857,"Commandement, Narration, Syllogisme, Sermon, Oration, and many other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,858,"such, are names of Speeches."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,859,Use Of Names Positive
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,860,And this is all the variety of Names Positive; which are put to mark
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,861,"somewhat which is in Nature, or may be feigned by the mind of man, as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,862,"Bodies that are, or may be conceived to be; or of bodies, the Properties"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,863,"that are, or may be feigned to be; or Words and Speech."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,864,Negative Names With Their Uses
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,865,"There be also other Names, called Negative; which are notes to signifie"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,866,that a word is not the name of the thing in question; as these words
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,867,"Nothing, No Man, Infinite, Indocible, Three Want Foure, and the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,868,"like; which are nevertheless of use in reckoning, or in correcting of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,869,"reckoning; and call to mind our past cogitations, though they be not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,870,names of any thing; because they make us refuse to admit of Names not
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,871,rightly used.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,872,Words Insignificant
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,873,"All other names, are but insignificant sounds; and those of two"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,874,"sorts. One, when they are new, and yet their meaning not explained by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,875,"Definition; whereof there have been aboundance coyned by Schoole-men,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,876,and pusled Philosophers.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,877,"Another, when men make a name of two Names, whose significations are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,878,"contradictory and inconsistent; as this name, an Incorporeall Body, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,879,"(which is all one) an Incorporeall Substance, and a great number more."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,880,"For whensoever any affirmation is false, the two names of which it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,881,"is composed, put together and made one, signifie nothing at all. For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,882,"example if it be a false affirmation to say A Quadrangle Is Round,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,883,the word Round Quadrangle signifies nothing; but is a meere sound. So
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,884,"likewise if it be false, to say that vertue can be powred, or blown up"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,885,"and down; the words In-powred Vertue, In-blown Vertue, are as absurd"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,886,"and insignificant, as a Round Quadrangle. And therefore you shall hardly"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,887,"meet with a senselesse and insignificant word, that is not made up of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,888,some Latin or Greek names. A Frenchman seldome hears our Saviour called
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,889,"by the name of Parole, but by the name of Verbe often; yet Verbe and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,890,"Parole differ no more, but that one is Latin, the other French."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,891,Understanding
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,892,"When a man upon the hearing of any Speech, hath those thoughts which the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,893,"words of that Speech, and their connexion, were ordained and constituted"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,894,to signifie; Then he is said to understand it; Understanding being
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,895,"nothing els, but conception caused by Speech. And therefore if Speech"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,896,"be peculiar to man (as for ought I know it is,) then is Understanding"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,897,"peculiar to him also. And therefore of absurd and false affirmations,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,898,"in case they be universall, there can be no Understanding; though many"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,899,"think they understand, then, when they do but repeat the words softly,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,900,or con them in their mind.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,901,"What kinds of Speeches signifie the Appetites, Aversions, and Passions"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,902,"of mans mind; and of their use and abuse, I shall speak when I have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,903,spoken of the Passions.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,904,Inconstant Names
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,905,"The names of such things as affect us, that is, which please, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,906,"displease us, because all men be not alike affected with the same thing,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,907,"nor the same man at all times, are in the common discourses of men, of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,908,Inconstant signification. For seeing all names are imposed to signifie
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,909,our conceptions; and all our affections are but conceptions; when we
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,910,"conceive the same things differently, we can hardly avoyd different"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,911,"naming of them. For though the nature of that we conceive, be the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,912,"same; yet the diversity of our reception of it, in respect of different"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,913,"constitutions of body, and prejudices of opinion, gives everything a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,914,"tincture of our different passions. And therefore in reasoning, a man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,915,bust take heed of words; which besides the signification of what we
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,916,"imagine of their nature, disposition, and interest of the speaker; such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,917,"as are the names of Vertues, and Vices; For one man calleth Wisdome,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,918,"what another calleth Feare; and one Cruelty, what another Justice;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,919,"one Prodigality, what another Magnanimity; one Gravity, what another"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,920,"Stupidity, &c. And therefore such names can never be true grounds of any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,921,"ratiocination. No more can Metaphors, and Tropes of speech: but these"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,922,"are less dangerous, because they profess their inconstancy; which the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,4,923,other do not.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,924,"CHAPTER V. OF REASON, AND SCIENCE."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,925,Reason What It Is
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,926,"When a man Reasoneth, hee does nothing els but conceive a summe totall,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,927,"from Addition of parcels; or conceive a Remainder, from Substraction of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,928,"one summe from another: which (if it be done by Words,) is conceiving of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,929,"the consequence of the names of all the parts, to the name of the whole;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,930,"or from the names of the whole and one part, to the name of the other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,931,"part. And though in some things, (as in numbers,) besides Adding and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,932,"Substracting, men name other operations, as Multiplying and Dividing;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,933,"yet they are the same; for Multiplication, is but Addition together of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,934,"things equall; and Division, but Substracting of one thing, as often as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,935,"we can. These operations are not incident to Numbers onely, but to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,936,"all manner of things that can be added together, and taken one out of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,937,another. For as Arithmeticians teach to adde and substract in Numbers;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,938,"so the Geometricians teach the same in Lines, Figures (solid and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,939,"superficiall,) Angles, Proportions, Times, degrees of Swiftnesse, Force,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,940,"Power, and the like; The Logicians teach the same in Consequences"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,941,"Of Words; adding together Two Names, to make an Affirmation; and Two"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,942,"Affirmations, to make a syllogisme; and Many syllogismes to make a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,943,"Demonstration; and from the Summe, or Conclusion of a syllogisme, they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,944,"substract one Proposition, to finde the other. Writers of Politiques,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,945,"adde together Pactions, to find mens Duties; and Lawyers, Lawes and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,946,"Facts, to find what is Right and Wrong in the actions of private men."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,947,"In summe, in what matter soever there is place for Addition and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,948,"Substraction, there also is place for Reason; and where these have no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,949,"place, there Reason has nothing at all to do."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,950,Reason Defined
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,951,"Out of all which we may define, (that is to say determine,) what that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,952,"is, which is meant by this word Reason, when wee reckon it amongst"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,953,"the Faculties of the mind. For Reason, in this sense, is nothing but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,954,"Reckoning (that is, Adding and Substracting) of the Consequences of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,955,"generall names agreed upon, for the Marking and Signifying of our"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,956,"thoughts; I say Marking them, when we reckon by our selves; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,957,"Signifying, when we demonstrate, or approve our reckonings to other men."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,958,Right Reason Where
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,959,"And as in Arithmetique, unpractised men must, and Professors themselves"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,960,"may often erre, and cast up false; so also in any other subject of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,961,"Reasoning, the ablest, most attentive, and most practised men, may"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,962,"deceive themselves, and inferre false Conclusions; Not but that Reason"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,963,"it selfe is always Right Reason, as well as Arithmetique is a certain"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,964,"and infallible art: But no one mans Reason, nor the Reason of any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,965,"one number of men, makes the certaintie; no more than an account is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,966,"therefore well cast up, because a great many men have unanimously"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,967,"approved it. And therfore, as when there is a controversy in an account,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,968,"the parties must by their own accord, set up for right Reason, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,969,"Reason of some Arbitrator, or Judge, to whose sentence they will"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,970,"both stand, or their controversie must either come to blowes, or be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,971,"undecided, for want of a right Reason constituted by Nature; so is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,972,it also in all debates of what kind soever: And when men that think
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,973,"themselves wiser than all others, clamor and demand right Reason for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,974,"judge; yet seek no more, but that things should be determined, by no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,975,"other mens reason but their own, it is as intolerable in the society of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,976,"men, as it is in play after trump is turned, to use for trump on every"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,977,"occasion, that suite whereof they have most in their hand. For they do"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,978,"nothing els, that will have every of their passions, as it comes to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,979,"bear sway in them, to be taken for right Reason, and that in their own"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,980,"controversies: bewraying their want of right Reason, by the claym they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,981,lay to it.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,982,The Use Of Reason
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,983,"The Use and End of Reason, is not the finding of the summe, and truth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,984,"of one, or a few consequences, remote from the first definitions, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,985,settled significations of names; but to begin at these; and proceed from
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,986,one consequence to another. For there can be no certainty of the last
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,987,"Conclusion, without a certainty of all those Affirmations and Negations,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,988,"on which it was grounded, and inferred. As when a master of a family,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,989,"in taking an account, casteth up the summs of all the bills of expence,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,990,"into one sum; and not regarding how each bill is summed up, by those"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,991,that give them in account; nor what it is he payes for; he advantages
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,992,"himselfe no more, than if he allowed the account in grosse, trusting to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,993,every of the accountants skill and honesty; so also in Reasoning of all
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,994,"other things, he that takes up conclusions on the trust of Authors, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,995,"doth not fetch them from the first Items in every Reckoning, (which are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,996,"the significations of names settled by definitions), loses his labour;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,997,and does not know any thing; but onely beleeveth.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,998,Of Error And Absurdity
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,999,"When a man reckons without the use of words, which may be done in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1000,"particular things, (as when upon the sight of any one thing, wee"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1001,"conjecture what was likely to have preceded, or is likely to follow upon"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1002,"it;) if that which he thought likely to follow, followes not; or that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1003,"which he thought likely to have preceded it, hath not preceded it, this"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1004,is called ERROR; to which even the most prudent men are subject. But
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1005,"when we Reason in Words of generall signification, and fall upon a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1006,"generall inference which is false; though it be commonly called Error,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1007,"it is indeed an ABSURDITY, or senseless Speech. For Error is but a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1008,"deception, in presuming that somewhat is past, or to come; of which,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1009,"though it were not past, or not to come; yet there was no impossibility"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1010,"discoverable. But when we make a generall assertion, unlesse it be a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1011,"true one, the possibility of it is unconceivable. And words whereby we"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1012,"conceive nothing but the sound, are those we call Absurd, insignificant,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1013,and Non-sense. And therefore if a man should talk to me of a Round
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1014,Quadrangle; or Accidents Of Bread In Cheese; or Immaterial Substances;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1015,"or of A Free Subject; A Free Will; or any Free, but free from being"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1016,"hindred by opposition, I should not say he were in an Errour; but that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1017,"his words were without meaning; that is to say, Absurd."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1018,"I have said before, (in the second chapter,) that a Man did excell"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1019,"all other Animals in this faculty, that when he conceived any thing"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1020,"whatsoever, he was apt to enquire the consequences of it, and what"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1021,effects he could do with it. And now I adde this other degree of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1022,"same excellence, that he can by words reduce the consequences he findes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1023,"to generall Rules, called Theoremes, or Aphorismes; that is, he can"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1024,"Reason, or reckon, not onely in number; but in all other things, whereof"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1025,"one may be added unto, or substracted from another."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1026,"But this priviledge, is allayed by another; and that is, by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1027,"priviledge of Absurdity; to which no living creature is subject, but man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1028,"onely. And of men, those are of all most subject to it, that professe"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1029,Philosophy. For it is most true that Cicero sayth of them somewhere;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1030,"that there can be nothing so absurd, but may be found in the books of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1031,Philosophers. And the reason is manifest. For there is not one of them
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1032,"that begins his ratiocination from the Definitions, or Explications of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1033,the names they are to use; which is a method that hath been used onely
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1034,in Geometry; whose Conclusions have thereby been made indisputable.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1035,Causes Of Absurditie
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1036,The first cause of Absurd conclusions I ascribe to the want of Method;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1037,in that they begin not their Ratiocination from Definitions; that
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1038,"is, from settled significations of their words: as if they could cast"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1039,"account, without knowing the value of the numerall words, One, Two, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1040,Three.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1041,"And whereas all bodies enter into account upon divers considerations,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1042,(which I have mentioned in the precedent chapter;) these considerations
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1043,"being diversly named, divers absurdities proceed from the confusion, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1044,unfit connexion of their names into assertions. And therefore
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1045,"The second cause of Absurd assertions, I ascribe to the giving of names"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1046,"of Bodies, to Accidents; or of Accidents, to Bodies; As they do, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1047,"say, Faith Is Infused, or Inspired; when nothing can be Powred, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1048,"Breathed into any thing, but body; and that, Extension is Body; that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1049,"Phantasmes are Spirits, &c."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1050,The third I ascribe to the giving of the names of the Accidents of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1051,"Bodies Without Us, to the Accidents of our Own Bodies; as they do that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1052,"say, the Colour Is In The Body; The Sound Is In The Ayre, &c."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1053,"The fourth, to the giving of the names of Bodies, to Names, or Speeches;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1054,"as they do that say, that There Be Things Universall; that A Living"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1055,"Creature Is Genus, or A Generall Thing, &c."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1056,"The fifth, to the giving of the names of Accidents, to Names and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1057,"Speeches; as they do that say, The Nature Of A Thing Is In Its"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1058,Definition; A Mans Command Is His Will; and the like.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1059,"The sixth, to the use of Metaphors, Tropes, and other Rhetoricall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1060,"figures, in stead of words proper. For though it be lawfull to say, (for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1061,"example) in common speech, The Way Goeth, Or Leadeth Hither, Or Thither,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1062,"The Proverb Sayes This Or That (whereas wayes cannot go, nor Proverbs"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1063,"speak;) yet in reckoning, and seeking of truth, such speeches are not to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1064,be admitted.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1065,"The seventh, to names that signifie nothing; but are taken up, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1066,"learned by rote from the Schooles, as Hypostatical, Transubstantiate,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1067,"Consubstantiate, Eternal-now, and the like canting of Schoole-men."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1068,"To him that can avoyd these things, it is not easie to fall into any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1069,"absurdity, unlesse it be by the length of an account; wherein he may"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1070,"perhaps forget what went before. For all men by nature reason alike, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1071,"well, when they have good principles. For who is so stupid, as both to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1072,"mistake in Geometry, and also to persist in it, when another detects his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1073,error to him?
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1074,Science
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1075,"By this it appears that Reason is not as Sense, and Memory, borne with"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1076,us; nor gotten by Experience onely; as Prudence is; but attayned by
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1077,Industry; first in apt imposing of Names; and secondly by getting a good
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1078,"and orderly Method in proceeding from the Elements, which are Names,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1079,to Assertions made by Connexion of one of them to another; and so to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1080,"syllogismes, which are the Connexions of one Assertion to another, till"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1081,we come to a knowledge of all the Consequences of names appertaining to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1082,"the subject in hand; and that is it, men call SCIENCE. And whereas"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1083,"Sense and Memory are but knowledge of Fact, which is a thing past, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1084,"irrevocable; Science is the knowledge of Consequences, and dependance"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1085,"of one fact upon another: by which, out of that we can presently do, we"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1086,"know how to do something els when we will, or the like, another time;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1087,"Because when we see how any thing comes about, upon what causes, and by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1088,"what manner; when the like causes come into our power, wee see how to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1089,make it produce the like effects.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1090,"Children therefore are not endued with Reason at all, till they have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1091,"attained the use of Speech: but are called Reasonable Creatures, for the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1092,possibility apparent of having the use of Reason in time to come. And
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1093,"the most part of men, though they have the use of Reasoning a little"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1094,"way, as in numbring to some degree; yet it serves them to little use in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1095,"common life; in which they govern themselves, some better, some worse,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1096,"according to their differences of experience, quicknesse of memory, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1097,inclinations to severall ends; but specially according to good or evill
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1098,"fortune, and the errors of one another. For as for Science, or certain"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1099,"rules of their actions, they are so farre from it, that they know"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1100,not what it is. Geometry they have thought Conjuring: but for other
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1101,"Sciences, they who have not been taught the beginnings, and some"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1102,"progresse in them, that they may see how they be acquired and generated,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1103,"are in this point like children, that having no thought of generation,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1104,"are made believe by the women, that their brothers and sisters are not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1105,"born, but found in the garden."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1106,"But yet they that have no Science, are in better, and nobler condition"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1107,"with their naturall Prudence; than men, that by mis-reasoning, or by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1108,"trusting them that reason wrong, fall upon false and absurd generall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1109,"rules. For ignorance of causes, and of rules, does not set men so farre"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1110,"out of their way, as relying on false rules, and taking for causes of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1111,"what they aspire to, those that are not so, but rather causes of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1112,contrary.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1113,"To conclude, The Light of humane minds is Perspicuous Words, but by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1114,"exact definitions first snuffed, and purged from ambiguity; Reason is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1115,"the Pace; Encrease of Science, the Way; and the Benefit of man-kind, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1116,"End. And on the contrary, Metaphors, and senslesse and ambiguous words,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1117,"are like Ignes Fatui; and reasoning upon them, is wandering amongst"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1118,"innumerable absurdities; and their end, contention, and sedition, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1119,contempt.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1120,"Prudence & Sapience, With Their Difference"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1121,"As, much Experience, is Prudence; so, is much Science, Sapience. For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1122,though wee usually have one name of Wisedome for them both; yet
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1123,"the Latines did always distinguish between Prudentia and Sapientia,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1124,"ascribing the former to Experience, the later to Science. But to make"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1125,"their difference appeare more cleerly, let us suppose one man endued"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1126,"with an excellent naturall use, and dexterity in handling his armes; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1127,"another to have added to that dexterity, an acquired Science, of where"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1128,"he can offend, or be offended by his adversarie, in every possible"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1129,"posture, or guard: The ability of the former, would be to the ability"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1130,"of the later, as Prudence to Sapience; both usefull; but the later"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1131,"infallible. But they that trusting onely to the authority of books,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1132,"follow the blind blindly, are like him that trusting to the false rules"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1133,"of the master of fence, ventures praesumptuously upon an adversary, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1134,"either kills, or disgraces him."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1135,Signes Of Science
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1136,"The signes of Science, are some, certain and infallible; some,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1137,"uncertain. Certain, when he that pretendeth the Science of any thing,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1138,"can teach the same; that is to say, demonstrate the truth thereof"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1139,"perspicuously to another: Uncertain, when onely some particular events"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1140,"answer to his pretence, and upon many occasions prove so as he sayes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1141,they must. Signes of prudence are all uncertain; because to observe by
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1142,"experience, and remember all circumstances that may alter the successe,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1143,"is impossible. But in any businesse, whereof a man has not infallible"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1144,"Science to proceed by; to forsake his own natural judgement, and be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1145,"guided by generall sentences read in Authors, and subject to many"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1146,"exceptions, is a signe of folly, and generally scorned by the name of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1147,"Pedantry. And even of those men themselves, that in Councells of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1148,"Common-wealth, love to shew their reading of Politiques and History,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1149,"very few do it in their domestique affaires, where their particular"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1150,interest is concerned; having Prudence enough for their private
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1151,affaires: but in publique they study more the reputation of their owne
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,5,1152,"wit, than the successe of anothers businesse."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1153,CHAPTER VI. OF THE INTERIOUR BEGINNINGS OF VOLUNTARY MOTIONS
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1154,COMMONLY CALLED THE PASSIONS. AND THE SPEECHES BY WHICH THEY ARE
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1155,EXPRESSED.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1156,Motion Vitall And Animal
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1157,"There be in Animals, two sorts of Motions peculiar to them: One called"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1158,"Vitall; begun in generation, and continued without interruption through"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1159,"their whole life; such as are the Course of the Bloud, the Pulse, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1160,"Breathing, the Concoctions, Nutrition, Excretion, &c; to which Motions"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1161,"there needs no help of Imagination: The other in Animal Motion,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1162,"otherwise called Voluntary Motion; as to Go, to Speak, to Move any of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1163,"our limbes, in such manner as is first fancied in our minds. That Sense,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1164,"is Motion in the organs and interiour parts of mans body, caused by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1165,"the action of the things we See, Heare, &c.; And that Fancy is but the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1166,"Reliques of the same Motion, remaining after Sense, has been already"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1167,"sayd in the first and second Chapters. And because Going, Speaking, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1168,"the like Voluntary motions, depend alwayes upon a precedent thought of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1169,"Whither, Which Way, and What; it is evident, that the Imagination is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1170,the first internall beginning of all Voluntary Motion. And although
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1171,"unstudied men, doe not conceive any motion at all to be there, where"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1172,"the thing moved is invisible; or the space it is moved in, is (for the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1173,"shortnesse of it) insensible; yet that doth not hinder, but that such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1174,"Motions are. For let a space be never so little, that which is moved"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1175,"over a greater space, whereof that little one is part, must first be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1176,"moved over that. These small beginnings of Motion, within the body"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1177,"of Man, before they appear in walking, speaking, striking, and other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1178,"visible actions, are commonly called ENDEAVOUR."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1179,Endeavour; Appetite; Desire; Hunger; Thirst; Aversion
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1180,"This Endeavour, when it is toward something which causes it, is called"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1181,"APPETITE, or DESIRE; the later, being the generall name; and the other,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1182,"oftentimes restrayned to signifie the Desire of Food, namely Hunger and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1183,"Thirst. And when the Endeavour is fromward something, it is generally"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1184,"called AVERSION. These words Appetite, and Aversion we have from the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1185,"Latines; and they both of them signifie the motions, one of approaching,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1186,"the other of retiring. So also do the Greek words for the same, which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1187,are orme and aphorme. For nature it selfe does often presse upon men
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1188,"those truths, which afterwards, when they look for somewhat beyond"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1189,"Nature, they stumble at. For the Schooles find in meere Appetite to go,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1190,"or move, no actuall Motion at all: but because some Motion they must"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1191,"acknowledge, they call it Metaphoricall Motion; which is but an absurd"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1192,"speech; for though Words may be called metaphoricall; Bodies, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1193,Motions cannot.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1194,"That which men Desire, they are also sayd to LOVE; and to HATE those"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1195,"things, for which they have Aversion. So that Desire, and Love, are the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1196,"same thing; save that by Desire, we alwayes signifie the Absence of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1197,"the object; by Love, most commonly the Presence of the same. So also"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1198,"by Aversion, we signifie the Absence; and by Hate, the Presence of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1199,Object.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1200,"Of Appetites, and Aversions, some are born with men; as Appetite of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1201,"food, Appetite of excretion, and exoneration, (which may also and more"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1202,"properly be called Aversions, from somewhat they feele in their Bodies;)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1203,"and some other Appetites, not many. The rest, which are Appetites of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1204,"particular things, proceed from Experience, and triall of their effects"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1205,"upon themselves, or other men. For of things wee know not at all, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1206,"believe not to be, we can have no further Desire, than to tast and try."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1207,"But Aversion wee have for things, not onely which we know have hurt us;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1208,"but also that we do not know whether they will hurt us, or not."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1209,Contempt
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1210,"Those things which we neither Desire, nor Hate, we are said to Contemne:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1211,"CONTEMPT being nothing els but an immobility, or contumacy of the Heart,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1212,in resisting the action of certain things; and proceeding from that the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1213,"Heart is already moved otherwise, by either more potent objects; or from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1214,want of experience of them.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1215,"And because the constitution of a mans Body, is in continuall mutation;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1216,it is impossible that all the same things should alwayes cause in him
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1217,"the same Appetites, and aversions: much lesse can all men consent, in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1218,the Desire of almost any one and the same Object.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1219,Good Evill
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1220,But whatsoever is the object of any mans Appetite or Desire; that is
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1221,"it, which he for his part calleth Good: And the object of his Hate,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1222,"and Aversion, evill; And of his contempt, Vile, and Inconsiderable."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1223,"For these words of Good, evill, and Contemptible, are ever used with"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1224,relation to the person that useth them: There being nothing simply and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1225,"absolutely so; nor any common Rule of Good and evill, to be taken from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1226,the nature of the objects themselves; but from the Person of the man
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1227,"(where there is no Common-wealth;) or, (in a Common-wealth,) From the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1228,"Person that representeth it; or from an Arbitrator or Judge, whom men"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1229,"disagreeing shall by consent set up, and make his sentence the Rule"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1230,thereof.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1231,Pulchrum Turpe; Delightfull Profitable; Unpleasant Unprofitable
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1232,"The Latine Tongue has two words, whose significations approach to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1233,those of Good and Evill; but are not precisely the same; And those are
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1234,"Pulchrum and Turpe. Whereof the former signifies that, which by some"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1235,"apparent signes promiseth Good; and the later, that, which promiseth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1236,evill. But in our Tongue we have not so generall names to expresse them
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1237,"by. But for Pulchrum, we say in some things, Fayre; in other Beautifull,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1238,"or Handsome, or Gallant, or Honourable, or Comely, or Amiable; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1239,"for Turpe, Foule, Deformed, Ugly, Base, Nauseous, and the like, as the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1240,"subject shall require; All which words, in their proper places signifie"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1241,"nothing els, but the Mine, or Countenance, that promiseth Good and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1242,"evill. So that of Good there be three kinds; Good in the Promise,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1243,"that is Pulchrum; Good in Effect, as the end desired, which is called"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1244,"Jucundum, Delightfull; and Good as the Means, which is called Utile,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1245,"Profitable; and as many of evill: For evill, in Promise, is that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1246,"they call Turpe; evill in Effect, and End, is Molestum, Unpleasant,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1247,"Troublesome; and evill in the Means, Inutile, Unprofitable, Hurtfull."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1248,Delight Displeasure
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1249,"As, in Sense, that which is really within us, is (As I have sayd"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1250,"before) onely Motion, caused by the action of externall objects, but in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1251,"apparence; to the Sight, Light and Colour; to the Eare, Sound; to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1252,"Nostrill, Odour, &c: so, when the action of the same object is continued"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1253,"from the Eyes, Eares, and other organs to the Heart; the real effect"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1254,"there is nothing but Motion, or Endeavour; which consisteth in Appetite,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1255,"or Aversion, to, or from the object moving. But the apparence, or sense"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1256,"of that motion, is that wee either call DELIGHT, or TROUBLE OF MIND."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1257,Pleasure Offence
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1258,"This Motion, which is called Appetite, and for the apparence of it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1259,"Delight, and Pleasure, seemeth to be, a corroboration of Vitall motion,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1260,"and a help thereunto; and therefore such things as caused Delight, were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1261,"not improperly called Jucunda, (A Juvando,) from helping or fortifying;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1262,"and the contrary, Molesta, Offensive, from hindering, and troubling the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1263,motion vitall.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1264,"Pleasure therefore, (or Delight,) is the apparence, or sense of Good;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1265,"and Molestation or Displeasure, the apparence, or sense of evill. And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1266,"consequently all Appetite, Desire, and Love, is accompanied with some"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1267,"Delight more or lesse; and all Hatred, and Aversion, with more or lesse"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1268,Displeasure and Offence.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1269,Pleasures Of Sense; Pleasures Of The Mind; Joy Paine Griefe
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1270,"Of Pleasures, or Delights, some arise from the sense of an object"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1271,"Present; And those may be called Pleasures Of Sense, (The word Sensuall,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1272,"as it is used by those onely that condemn them, having no place till"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1273,there be Lawes.) Of this kind are all Onerations and Exonerations of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1274,"body; as also all that is pleasant, in the Sight, Hearing, Smell,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1275,"Tast, Or Touch; Others arise from the Expectation, that proceeds from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1276,"foresight of the End, or Consequence of things; whether those things in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1277,the Sense Please or Displease: And these are Pleasures Of The Mind of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1278,him that draweth those consequences; and are generally called JOY. In
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1279,"the like manner, Displeasures, are some in the Sense, and called PAYNE;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1280,"others, in the Expectation of consequences, and are called GRIEFE."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1281,"These simple Passions called Appetite, Desire, Love, Aversion, Hate,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1282,"Joy, and griefe, have their names for divers considerations diversified."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1283,"As first, when they one succeed another, they are diversly called from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1284,the opinion men have of the likelihood of attaining what they
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1285,"desire. Secondly, from the object loved or hated. Thirdly, from the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1286,"consideration of many of them together. Fourthly, from the Alteration or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1287,succession it selfe.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1288,"Hope-- For Appetite with an opinion of attaining, is called HOPE."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1289,"Despaire-- The same, without such opinion, DESPAIRE."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1290,"Feare-- Aversion, with opinion of Hurt from the object, FEARE."

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1325,"living creature but Man; so that Man is distinguished, not onely by his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1326,Reason; but also by this singular Passion from other Animals; in whom
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1327,"the appetite of food, and other pleasures of Sense, by praedominance,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1328,"take away the care of knowing causes; which is a Lust of the mind,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1329,that by a perseverance of delight in the continuall and indefatigable
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1330,"generation of Knowledge, exceedeth the short vehemence of any carnall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1331,Pleasure.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1332,"Religion Superstition; True Religion-- Feare of power invisible, feigned"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1333,"by the mind, or imagined from tales publiquely allowed, RELIGION; not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1334,"allowed, superstition. And when the power imagined is truly such as we"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1336,"Panique Terrour-- Feare, without the apprehension of why, or what,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1337,PANIQUE TERROR; called so from the fables that make Pan the author of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1338,"them; whereas in truth there is always in him that so feareth, first,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1339,"some apprehension of the cause, though the rest run away by example;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1340,every one supposing his fellow to know why. And therefore this Passion
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1341,"happens to none but in a throng, or multitude of people."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1342,"Admiration-- Joy, from apprehension of novelty, ADMIRATION; proper to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1343,"man, because it excites the appetite of knowing the cause."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1344,"Glory Vaine-glory-- Joy, arising from imagination of a man's own power"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1345,"and ability, is that exultation of the mind which is called GLORYING:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1346,"which, if grounded upon the experience of his own former actions, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1347,"the same with Confidence: but if grounded on the flattery of others, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1348,"onely supposed by himselfe, for delight in the consequences of it,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1349,is called VAINE-GLORY: which name is properly given; because a
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1350,well-grounded Confidence begetteth attempt; whereas the supposing of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1351,"power does not, and is therefore rightly called Vaine."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1352,"Dejection-- Griefe, from opinion of want of power, is called dejection"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1353,of mind.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1354,The Vaine-glory which consisteth in the feigning or supposing of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1355,"abilities in ourselves, which we know are not, is most incident to young"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1356,"men, and nourished by the Histories or Fictions of Gallant Persons; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1357,"is corrected often times by Age, and Employment."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1358,"Sudden Glory Laughter-- Sudden glory, is the passion which maketh those"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1359,Grimaces called LAUGHTER; and is caused either by some sudden act of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1360,"their own, that pleaseth them; or by the apprehension of some"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1361,"deformed thing in another, by comparison whereof they suddenly applaud"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1362,"themselves. And it is incident most to them, that are conscious of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1363,fewest abilities in themselves; who are forced to keep themselves in
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1364,"their own favour, by observing the imperfections of other men."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1365,And therefore much Laughter at the defects of others is a signe of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1366,"Pusillanimity. For of great minds, one of the proper workes is, to help"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1367,and free others from scorn; and compare themselves onely with the most
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1368,able.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1369,"Sudden Dejection Weeping-- On the contrary, Sudden Dejection is the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1370,"passion that causeth WEEPING; and is caused by such accidents, as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1371,"suddenly take away some vehement hope, or some prop of their power: and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1372,"they are most subject to it, that rely principally on helps externall,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1373,"such as are Women, and Children. Therefore, some Weep for the loss of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1374,Friends; Others for their unkindnesse; others for the sudden stop made
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1375,"to their thoughts of revenge, by Reconciliation. But in all cases, both"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1376,"Laughter and Weeping, are sudden motions; Custome taking them both away."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1377,For no man Laughs at old jests; or Weeps for an old calamity.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1378,"Shame Blushing-- Griefe, for the discovery of some defect of ability"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1379,"is SHAME, or the passion that discovereth itself in BLUSHING; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1380,consisteth in the apprehension of some thing dishonourable; and in young
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1381,"men, is a signe of the love of good reputation; and commendable: in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1382,"old men it is a signe of the same; but because it comes too late, not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1383,commendable.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1384,Impudence-- The Contempt of good reputation is called IMPUDENCE.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1385,"Pitty-- Griefe, for the calamity of another is PITTY; and ariseth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1386,from the imagination that the like calamity may befall himselfe; and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1387,"therefore is called also COMPASSION, and in the phrase of this present"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1388,time a FELLOW-FEELING: and therefore for Calamity arriving from
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1389,"great wickedness, the best men have the least Pitty; and for the same"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1390,"Calamity, those have least Pitty, that think themselves least obnoxious"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1391,to the same.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1392,"Cruelty-- Contempt, or little sense of the calamity of others, is that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1393,which men call CRUELTY; proceeding from Security of their own fortune.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1394,"For, that any man should take pleasure in other mens' great harmes,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1395,"without other end of his own, I do not conceive it possible."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1396,"Emulation Envy-- Griefe, for the success of a Competitor in wealth,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1397,"honour, or other good, if it be joyned with Endeavour to enforce our own"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1398,"abilities to equal or exceed him, is called EMULATION: but joyned with"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1399,"Endeavour to supplant or hinder a Competitor, ENVIE."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1400,"Deliberation-- When in the mind of man, Appetites and Aversions, Hopes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1401,"and Feares, concerning one and the same thing, arise alternately; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1402,"divers good and evill consequences of the doing, or omitting the thing"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1403,"propounded, come successively into our thoughts; so that sometimes we"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1407,"either done, or thought impossible, is that we call DELIBERATION."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1408,"Therefore of things past, there is no Deliberation; because manifestly"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1409,"impossible to be changed: nor of things known to be impossible, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1410,"thought so; because men know, or think such Deliberation vaine. But"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1411,"of things impossible, which we think possible, we may Deliberate; not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1412,knowing it is in vain. And it is called DELIBERATION; because it is a
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1413,"putting an end to the Liberty we had of doing, or omitting, according to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1414,"our own Appetite, or Aversion."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1415,"This alternate succession of Appetites, Aversions, Hopes and Feares is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1416,no less in other living Creatures than in Man; and therefore Beasts also
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1417,Deliberate.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1418,Every Deliberation is then sayd to End when that whereof they
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1419,"Deliberate, is either done, or thought impossible; because till then wee"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1420,"retain the liberty of doing, or omitting, according to our Appetite, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1421,Aversion.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1422,The Will
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1423,"In Deliberation, the last Appetite, or Aversion, immediately adhaering"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1424,"to the action, or to the omission thereof, is that wee call the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1425,"WILL; the Act, (not the faculty,) of Willing. And Beasts that have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1426,Deliberation must necessarily also have Will. The Definition of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1427,"Will, given commonly by the Schooles, that it is a Rationall Appetite,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1428,"is not good. For if it were, then could there be no Voluntary Act"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1429,"against Reason. For a Voluntary Act is that, which proceedeth from the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1430,"Will, and no other. But if in stead of a Rationall Appetite, we shall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1431,"say an Appetite resulting from a precedent Deliberation, then the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1432,"Definition is the same that I have given here. Will, therefore, Is The"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1433,"Last Appetite In Deliberating. And though we say in common Discourse, a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1434,"man had a Will once to do a thing, that neverthelesse he forbore to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1435,"do; yet that is properly but an Inclination, which makes no Action"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1436,"Voluntary; because the action depends not of it, but of the last"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1437,"Inclination, or Appetite. For if the intervenient Appetites make any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1438,"action Voluntary, then by the same reason all intervenient Aversions"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1439,should make the same action Involuntary; and so one and the same action
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1440,should be both Voluntary & Involuntary.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1441,"By this it is manifest, that not onely actions that have their beginning"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1442,"from Covetousness, Ambition, Lust, or other Appetites to the thing"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1443,"propounded; but also those that have their beginning from Aversion,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1444,"or Feare of those consequences that follow the omission, are Voluntary"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1445,Actions.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1446,"Formes Of Speech, In Passion"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1447,"The formes of Speech by which the Passions are expressed, are partly the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1448,"same, and partly different from those, by which we express our Thoughts."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1449,"And first generally all Passions may be expressed Indicatively; as, I"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1450,"Love, I Feare, I Joy, I Deliberate, I Will, I Command: but some of them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1451,"have particular expressions by themselves, which nevertheless are not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1452,"affirmations, unless it be when they serve to make other inferences,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1453,besides that of the Passion they proceed from. Deliberation is expressed
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1454,"Subjunctively; which is a speech proper to signifie suppositions, with"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1455,"their consequences; as, If This Be Done, Then This Will Follow; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1456,"differs not from the language of Reasoning, save that Reasoning is in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1457,"generall words, but Deliberation for the most part is of Particulars."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1458,"The language of Desire, and Aversion, is Imperative; as, Do This,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1459,"Forbear That; which when the party is obliged to do, or forbear, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1460,"Command; otherwise Prayer; or els Counsell. The language of Vaine-Glory,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1461,"of Indignation, Pitty and Revengefulness, Optative: but of the Desire to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1462,"know, there is a peculiar expression called Interrogative; as, What Is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1463,"It, When Shall It, How Is It Done, and Why So? Other language of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1464,"Passions I find none: for Cursing, Swearing, Reviling, and the like, do"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1465,not signifie as Speech; but as the actions of a tongue accustomed.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1466,"These forms of Speech, I say, are expressions, or voluntary"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1467,significations of our Passions: but certain signes they be not; because
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1468,"they may be used arbitrarily, whether they that use them, have such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1469,"Passions or not. The best signes of Passions present, are either in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1470,"countenance, motions of the body, actions, and ends, or aims, which we"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1471,otherwise know the man to have.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1472,Good And Evill Apparent
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1473,And because in Deliberation the Appetites and Aversions are raised by
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1474,"foresight of the good and evill consequences, and sequels of the action"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1475,whereof we Deliberate; the good or evill effect thereof dependeth on the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1476,"foresight of a long chain of consequences, of which very seldome any man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1477,"is able to see to the end. But for so far as a man seeth, if the Good"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1478,"in those consequences be greater than the evill, the whole chain is that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1479,"which Writers call Apparent or Seeming Good. And contrarily, when the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1480,"evill exceedeth the good, the whole is Apparent or Seeming Evill: so"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1481,"that he who hath by Experience, or Reason, the greatest and surest"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1482,"prospect of Consequences, Deliberates best himself; and is able, when he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1483,"will, to give the best counsel unto others."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1484,Felicity
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1485,Continual Successe in obtaining those things which a man from time to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1486,"time desireth, that is to say, continual prospering, is that men call"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1487,FELICITY; I mean the Felicity of this life. For there is no such thing
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1488,"as perpetual Tranquillity of mind, while we live here; because Life"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1489,"itself is but Motion, and can never be without Desire, nor without"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1490,"Feare, no more than without Sense. What kind of Felicity God hath"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1491,"ordained to them that devoutly honour him, a man shall no sooner know,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1492,"than enjoy; being joys, that now are as incomprehensible, as the word of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1493,"School-men, Beatifical Vision, is unintelligible."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1494,Praise Magnification
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1495,The form of speech whereby men signifie their opinion of the Goodnesse
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1496,of anything is PRAISE. That whereby they signifie the power and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1497,greatness of anything is MAGNIFYING. And that whereby they signifie
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1498,the opinion they have of a man's felicity is by the Greeks called
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1499,"Makarismos, for which we have no name in our tongue. And thus much is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,6,1500,sufficient for the present purpose to have been said of the passions.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1501,CHAPTER VII. OF THE ENDS OR RESOLUTIONS OF DISCOURSE
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1502,"Of all Discourse, governed by desire of Knowledge, there is at last"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1503,"an End, either by attaining, or by giving over. And in the chain of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1504,"Discourse, wheresoever it be interrupted, there is an End for that time."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1505,"Judgement, or Sentence Final; Doubt"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1506,"If the Discourse be meerly Mentall, it consisteth of thoughts that the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1507,"thing will be, and will not be; or that it has been, and has not been,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1508,alternately. So that wheresoever you break off the chayn of a mans
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1509,"Discourse, you leave him in a Praesumption of It Will Be, or, It Will"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1510,"Not Be; or it Has Been, or, Has Not Been. All which is Opinion. And that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1511,"which is alternate Appetite, in Deliberating concerning Good and Evil,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1512,"the same is alternate Opinion in the Enquiry of the truth of Past, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1513,"Future. And as the last Appetite in Deliberation is called the Will, so"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1514,"the last Opinion in search of the truth of Past, and Future, is called"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1515,"the JUDGEMENT, or Resolute and Final Sentence of him that Discourseth."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1516,"And as the whole chain of Appetites alternate, in the question of Good"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1517,"or Bad is called Deliberation; so the whole chain of Opinions alternate,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1518,"in the question of True, or False is called DOUBT."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1519,"No Discourse whatsoever, can End in absolute knowledge of Fact, past, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1520,"to come. For, as for the knowledge of Fact, it is originally, Sense; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1521,"ever after, Memory. And for the knowledge of consequence, which I have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1522,"said before is called Science, it is not Absolute, but Conditionall. No"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1523,"man can know by Discourse, that this, or that, is, has been, or will"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1524,"be; which is to know absolutely: but onely, that if This be, That is; if"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1525,"This has been, That has been; if This shall be, That shall be: which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1526,is to know conditionally; and that not the consequence of one thing to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1527,"another; but of one name of a thing, to another name of the same thing."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1528,Science Opinion Conscience
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1529,"And therefore, when the Discourse is put into Speech, and begins with"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1530,"the Definitions of Words, and proceeds by Connexion of the same into"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1531,"general Affirmations, and of these again into Syllogismes, the end or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1532,last sum is called the Conclusion; and the thought of the mind by it
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1533,"signified is that conditional Knowledge, or Knowledge of the consequence"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1534,"of words, which is commonly called Science. But if the first ground of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1535,"such Discourse be not Definitions, or if the Definitions be not rightly"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1536,"joyned together into Syllogismes, then the End or Conclusion is again"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1537,"OPINION, namely of the truth of somewhat said, though sometimes in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1538,"absurd and senslesse words, without possibility of being understood."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1539,"When two, or more men, know of one and the same fact, they are said"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1540,to be CONSCIOUS of it one to another; which is as much as to know it
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1541,together. And because such are fittest witnesses of the facts of one
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1542,"another, or of a third, it was, and ever will be reputed a very Evill"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1543,"act, for any man to speak against his Conscience; or to corrupt or force"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1544,"another so to do: Insomuch that the plea of Conscience, has been always"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1545,"hearkened unto very diligently in all times. Afterwards, men made use"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1546,"of the same word metaphorically, for the knowledge of their own secret"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1547,"facts, and secret thoughts; and therefore it is Rhetorically said that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1548,"the Conscience is a thousand witnesses. And last of all, men, vehemently"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1549,"in love with their own new opinions, (though never so absurd,) and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1550,"obstinately bent to maintain them, gave those their opinions also that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1551,"reverenced name of Conscience, as if they would have it seem unlawful,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1552,"to change or speak against them; and so pretend to know they are true,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1553,when they know at most but that they think so.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1554,Beliefe Faith
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1555,"When a mans Discourse beginneth not at Definitions, it beginneth either"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1556,"at some other contemplation of his own, and then it is still called"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1557,"Opinion; Or it beginneth at some saying of another, of whose ability to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1558,"know the truth, and of whose honesty in not deceiving, he doubteth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1559,"not; and then the Discourse is not so much concerning the Thing, as the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1560,"Person; And the Resolution is called BELEEFE, and FAITH: Faith, In the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1561,"man; Beleefe, both Of the man, and Of the truth of what he sayes. So"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1562,then in Beleefe are two opinions; one of the saying of the man; the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1563,"other of his vertue. To Have Faith In, or Trust To, or Beleeve A Man,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1564,"signifie the same thing; namely, an opinion of the veracity of the man:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1565,"But to Beleeve What Is Said, signifieth onely an opinion of the truth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1566,"of the saying. But wee are to observe that this Phrase, I Beleeve In;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1567,"as also the Latine, Credo In; and the Greek, Pisteno Eis, are never used"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1568,"but in the writings of Divines. In stead of them, in other writings are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1569,"put, I Beleeve Him; I Have Faith In Him; I Rely On Him: and in Latin,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1570,"Credo Illi; Fido Illi: and in Greek, Pisteno Anto: and that this"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1571,singularity of the Ecclesiastical use of the word hath raised many
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1572,disputes about the right object of the Christian Faith.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1573,"But by Beleeving In, as it is in the Creed, is meant, not trust in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1574,Person; but Confession and acknowledgement of the Doctrine. For not
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1575,"onely Christians, but all manner of men do so believe in God, as to hold"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1576,"all for truth they heare him say, whether they understand it, or not;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1577,which is all the Faith and trust can possibly be had in any person
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1578,whatsoever: But they do not all believe the Doctrine of the Creed.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1579,"From whence we may inferre, that when wee believe any saying whatsoever"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1580,"it be, to be true, from arguments taken, not from the thing it selfe, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1581,"from the principles of naturall Reason, but from the Authority, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1582,"good opinion wee have, of him that hath sayd it; then is the speaker, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1583,"person we believe in, or trust in, and whose word we take, the object of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1584,"our Faith; and the Honour done in Believing, is done to him onely. And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1585,"consequently, when wee Believe that the Scriptures are the word of God,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1586,"having no immediate revelation from God himselfe, our Beleefe, Faith,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1587,"and Trust is in the Church; whose word we take, and acquiesce therein."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1588,And they that believe that which a Prophet relates unto them in the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1589,"name of God, take the word of the Prophet, do honour to him, and in him"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1590,"trust, and believe, touching the truth of what he relateth, whether he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1591,"be a true, or a false Prophet. And so it is also with all other History."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1592,"For if I should not believe all that is written By Historians, of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1593,"glorious acts of Alexander, or Caesar; I do not think the Ghost of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1594,"Alexander, or Caesar, had any just cause to be offended; or any body"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1595,"else, but the Historian. If Livy say the Gods made once a Cow speak, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1596,"we believe it not; wee distrust not God therein, but Livy. So that it is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1597,"evident, that whatsoever we believe, upon no other reason, than what is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1598,"drawn from authority of men onely, and their writings; whether they be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,7,1599,"sent from God or not, is Faith in men onely."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1600,CHAPTER VIII. OF THE VERTUES COMMONLY CALLED INTELLECTUAL;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1601,AND THEIR CONTRARY DEFECTS
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1602,Intellectuall Vertue Defined
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1603,"Vertue generally, in all sorts of subjects, is somewhat that is valued"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1604,for eminence; and consisteth in comparison. For if all things
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1605,"were equally in all men, nothing would be prized. And by Vertues"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1606,"INTELLECTUALL, are always understood such abilityes of the mind, as men"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1607,"praise, value, and desire should be in themselves; and go commonly under"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1608,"the name of a Good Witte; though the same word Witte, be used also, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1609,distinguish one certain ability from the rest.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1610,"Wit, Naturall, Or Acquired"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1611,"These Vertues are of two sorts; Naturall, and Acquired. By Naturall, I"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1612,"mean not, that which a man hath from his Birth: for that is nothing else"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1613,"but Sense; wherein men differ so little one from another, and from brute"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1614,"Beasts, as it is not to be reckoned amongst Vertues. But I mean, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1615,"Witte, which is gotten by Use onely, and Experience; without Method,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1616,"Culture, or Instruction. This NATURALL WITTE, consisteth principally"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1617,"in two things; Celerity Of Imagining, (that is, swift succession of one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1618,thought to another;) and Steddy Direction to some approved end. On the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1619,"Contrary a slow Imagination, maketh that Defect, or fault of the mind,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1620,"which is commonly called DULNESSE, Stupidity, and sometimes by other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1621,"names that signifie slownesse of motion, or difficulty to be moved."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1622,"Good Wit, Or Fancy; Good Judgement; Discretion"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1623,"And this difference of quicknesse, is caused by the difference of mens"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1624,"passions; that love and dislike, some one thing, some another: and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1625,"therefore some mens thoughts run one way, some another: and are held to,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1626,and observe differently the things that passe through their imagination.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1627,"And whereas in his succession of mens thoughts, there is nothing to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1628,"observe in the things they think on, but either in what they be Like One"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1629,"Another, or in what they be Unlike, or What They Serve For, or How They"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1630,"Serve To Such A Purpose; Those that observe their similitudes, in case"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1631,"they be such as are but rarely observed by others, are sayd to have a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1632,"Good Wit; by which, in this occasion, is meant a Good Fancy. But they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1633,"that observe their differences, and dissimilitudes; which is called"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1634,"Distinguishing, and Discerning, and Judging between thing and thing; in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1635,"case, such discerning be not easie, are said to have a Good Judgement:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1636,"and particularly in matter of conversation and businesse; wherein,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1637,"times, places, and persons are to be discerned, this Vertue is called"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1638,"DISCRETION. The former, that is, Fancy, without the help of Judgement,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1639,"is not commended as a Vertue: but the later which is Judgement, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1640,"Discretion, is commended for it selfe, without the help of Fancy."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1641,"Besides the Discretion of times, places, and persons, necessary to a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1642,"good Fancy, there is required also an often application of his thoughts"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1643,"to their End; that is to say, to some use to be made of them. This done;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1644,"he that hath this Vertue, will be easily fitted with similitudes, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1645,"will please, not onely by illustration of his discourse, and adorning it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1646,"with new and apt metaphors; but also, by the rarity or their invention."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1647,"But without Steddinesse, and Direction to some End, a great Fancy is one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1648,"kind of Madnesse; such as they have, that entring into any discourse,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1649,"are snatched from their purpose, by every thing that comes in their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1650,"thought, into so many, and so long digressions, and parentheses, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1651,"they utterly lose themselves: Which kind of folly, I know no particular"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1652,"name for: but the cause of it is, sometimes want of experience; whereby"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1653,"that seemeth to a man new and rare, which doth not so to others:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1654,"sometimes Pusillanimity; by which that seems great to him, which other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1655,"men think a trifle: and whatsoever is new, or great, and therefore"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1656,"thought fit to be told, withdrawes a man by degrees from the intended"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1657,way of his discourse.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1658,"In a good Poem, whether it be Epique, or Dramatique; as also in Sonnets,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1659,"Epigrams, and other Pieces, both Judgement and Fancy are required:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1660,But the Fancy must be more eminent; because they please for the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1661,Extravagancy; but ought not to displease by Indiscretion.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1662,"In a good History, the Judgement must be eminent; because the goodnesse"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1663,"consisteth, in the Method, in the Truth, and in the Choyse of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1664,"actions that are most profitable to be known. Fancy has no place, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1665,onely in adorning the stile.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1666,"In Orations of Prayse, and in Invectives, the Fancy is praedominant;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1667,"because the designe is not truth, but to Honour or Dishonour; which is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1668,"done by noble, or by vile comparisons. The Judgement does but suggest"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1669,"what circumstances make an action laudable, or culpable."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1670,"In Hortatives, and Pleadings, as Truth, or Disguise serveth best to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1671,"Designe in hand; so is the Judgement, or the Fancy most required."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1672,"In Demonstration, in Councell, and all rigourous search of Truth,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1673,Judgement does all; except sometimes the understanding have need to be
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1674,opened by some apt similitude; and then there is so much use of Fancy.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1675,"But for Metaphors, they are in this case utterly excluded. For seeing"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1676,"they openly professe deceipt; to admit them into Councell, or Reasoning,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1677,were manifest folly.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1678,"And in any Discourse whatsoever, if the defect of Discretion be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1679,"apparent, how extravagant soever the Fancy be, the whole discourse"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1680,will be taken for a signe of want of wit; and so will it never when the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1681,"Discretion is manifest, though the Fancy be never so ordinary."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1682,"The secret thoughts of a man run over all things, holy, prophane,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1683,"clean, obscene, grave, and light, without shame, or blame; which verball"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1684,"discourse cannot do, farther than the Judgement shall approve of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1685,"Time, Place, and Persons. An Anatomist, or a Physitian may speak, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1686,"write his judgement of unclean things; because it is not to please,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1687,"but profit: but for another man to write his extravagant, and pleasant"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1688,"fancies of the same, is as if a man, from being tumbled into the dirt,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1689,should come and present himselfe before good company. And 'tis the want
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1690,"of Discretion that makes the difference. Again, in profest remissnesse"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1691,"of mind, and familiar company, a man may play with the sounds, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1692,aequivocal significations of words; and that many times with encounters
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1693,"of extraordinary Fancy: but in a Sermon, or in publique, or before"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1694,"persons unknown, or whom we ought to reverence, there is no Gingling of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1695,words that will not be accounted folly: and the difference is onely in
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1696,"the want of Discretion. So that where Wit is wanting, it is not Fancy"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1697,"that is wanting, but Discretion. Judgement therefore without Fancy is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1698,"Wit, but Fancy without Judgement not."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1699,Prudence
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1700,"When the thoughts of a man, that has a designe in hand, running over a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1701,"multitude of things, observes how they conduce to that designe; or what"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1702,designe they may conduce into; if his observations be such as are not
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1703,"easie, or usuall, This wit of his is called PRUDENCE; and dependeth on"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1704,"much Experience, and Memory of the like things, and their consequences"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1705,"heretofore. In which there is not so much difference of Men, as there is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1706,in their Fancies and Judgements; Because the Experience of men equall
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1707,"in age, is not much unequall, as to the quantity; but lyes in different"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1708,occasions; every one having his private designes. To govern well a
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1709,"family, and a kingdome, are not different degrees of Prudence; but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1710,"different sorts of businesse; no more then to draw a picture in little,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1711,"or as great, or greater then the life, are different degrees of Art. A"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1712,"plain husband-man is more Prudent in affaires of his own house, then a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1713,Privy Counseller in the affaires of another man.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1714,Craft
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1715,"To Prudence, if you adde the use of unjust, or dishonest means, such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1716,"as usually are prompted to men by Feare, or Want; you have that Crooked"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1717,"Wisdome, which is called CRAFT; which is a signe of Pusillanimity. For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1718,"Magnanimity is contempt of unjust, or dishonest helps. And that which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1719,"the Latines Call Versutia, (translated into English, Shifting,) and is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1720,"a putting off of a present danger or incommodity, by engaging into"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1721,"a greater, as when a man robbs one to pay another, is but a shorter"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1722,"sighted Craft, called Versutia, from Versura, which signifies taking"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1723,"mony at usurie, for the present payment of interest."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1724,Acquired Wit
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1725,"As for Acquired Wit, (I mean acquired by method and instruction,) there"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1726,is none but Reason; which is grounded on the right use of Speech; and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1727,"produceth the Sciences. But of Reason and Science, I have already spoken"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1728,in the fifth and sixth Chapters.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1729,"The causes of this difference of Witts, are in the Passions: and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1730,"the difference of Passions, proceedeth partly from the different"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1731,"Constitution of the body, and partly from different Education. For if"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1732,"the difference proceeded from the temper of the brain, and the organs of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1733,"Sense, either exterior or interior, there would be no lesse difference"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1734,"of men in their Sight, Hearing, or other Senses, than in their Fancies,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1735,and Discretions. It proceeds therefore from the Passions; which are
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1736,"different, not onely from the difference of mens complexions; but also"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1737,"from their difference of customes, and education."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1738,"The Passions that most of all cause the differences of Wit, are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1739,"principally, the more or lesse Desire of Power, of Riches, of Knowledge,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1740,"and of Honour. All which may be reduced to the first, that is Desire of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1741,"Power. For Riches, Knowledge and Honour are but severall sorts of Power."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1742,Giddinesse Madnesse
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1743,"And therefore, a man who has no great Passion for any of these things;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1744,but is as men terme it indifferent; though he may be so farre a good
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1745,"man, as to be free from giving offence; yet he cannot possibly have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1746,"either a great Fancy, or much Judgement. For the Thoughts, are to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1747,"Desires, as Scouts, and Spies, to range abroad, and find the way to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1748,"things Desired: All Stedinesse of the minds motion, and all quicknesse"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1749,"of the same, proceeding from thence. For as to have no Desire, is to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1750,"be Dead: so to have weak Passions, is Dulnesse; and to have Passions"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1751,"indifferently for every thing, GIDDINESSE, and Distraction; and to have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1752,"stronger, and more vehement Passions for any thing, than is ordinarily"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1753,"seen in others, is that which men call MADNESSE."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1754,"Whereof there be almost as many kinds, as of the Passions themselves."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1755,"Sometimes the extraordinary and extravagant Passion, proceedeth from the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1756,"evill constitution of the organs of the Body, or harme done them; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1757,"sometimes the hurt, and indisposition of the Organs, is caused by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1758,"vehemence, or long continuance of the Passion. But in both cases the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1759,Madnesse is of one and the same nature.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1760,"The Passion, whose violence, or continuance maketh Madnesse, is either"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1761,"great Vaine-Glory; which is commonly called Pride, and Selfe-Conceipt;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1762,or great Dejection of mind.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1763,Rage
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1764,"Pride, subjecteth a man to Anger, the excesse whereof, is the Madnesse"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1765,"called RAGE, and FURY. And thus it comes to passe that excessive desire"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1766,"of Revenge, when it becomes habituall, hurteth the organs, and becomes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1767,"Rage: That excessive love, with jealousie, becomes also Rage: Excessive"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1768,"opinion of a mans own selfe, for divine inspiration, for wisdome,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1769,"learning, forme, and the like, becomes Distraction, and Giddinesse:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1770,"the same, joyned with Envy, Rage: Vehement opinion of the truth of any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1771,"thing, contradicted by others, Rage."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1772,Melancholy
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1773,"Dejection, subjects a man to causelesse fears; which is a Madnesse"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1774,"commonly called MELANCHOLY, apparent also in divers manners; as in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1775,"haunting of solitudes, and graves; in superstitious behaviour; and in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1776,"fearing some one, some another particular thing. In summe, all Passions"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1777,"that produce strange and unusuall behaviour, are called by the generall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1778,"name of Madnesse. But of the severall kinds of Madnesse, he that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1779,"would take the paines, might enrowle a legion. And if the Excesses be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1780,"madnesse, there is no doubt but the Passions themselves, when they tend"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1781,"to Evill, are degrees of the same."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1782,"(For example,) Though the effect of folly, in them that are possessed of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1783,"an opinion of being inspired, be not visible alwayes in one man, by any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1784,"very extravagant action, that proceedeth from such Passion; yet when"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1785,"many of them conspire together, the Rage of the whole multitude is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1786,"visible enough. For what argument of Madnesse can there be greater, than"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1787,"to clamour, strike, and throw stones at our best friends? Yet this is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1788,"somewhat lesse than such a multitude will do. For they will clamour,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1789,"fight against, and destroy those, by whom all their lifetime before,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1790,"they have been protected, and secured from injury. And if this be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1791,"Madnesse in the multitude, it is the same in every particular man. For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1792,"as in the middest of the sea, though a man perceive no sound of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1793,"that part of the water next him; yet he is well assured, that part"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1794,"contributes as much, to the Roaring of the Sea, as any other part, of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1795,"the same quantity: so also, thought wee perceive no great unquietnesse,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1796,"in one, or two men; yet we may be well assured, that their singular"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1797,"Passions, are parts of the Seditious roaring of a troubled Nation. And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1798,if there were nothing else that bewrayed their madnesse; yet that very
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1799,"arrogating such inspiration to themselves, is argument enough. If some"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1800,man in Bedlam should entertaine you with sober discourse; and you desire
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1801,"in taking leave, to know what he were, that you might another time"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1802,"requite his civility; and he should tell you, he were God the Father;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1803,I think you need expect no extravagant action for argument of his
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1804,Madnesse.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1805,"This opinion of Inspiration, called commonly, Private Spirit, begins"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1806,"very often, from some lucky finding of an Errour generally held by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1807,"others; and not knowing, or not remembring, by what conduct of reason,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1808,"they came to so singular a truth, (as they think it, though it be many"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1809,"times an untruth they light on,) they presently admire themselves; as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1810,"being in the speciall grace of God Almighty, who hath revealed the same"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1811,"to them supernaturally, by his Spirit."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1812,"Again, that Madnesse is nothing else, but too much appearing Passion,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1813,"may be gathered out of the effects of Wine, which are the same with"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1814,those of the evill disposition of the organs. For the variety of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1815,"behaviour in men that have drunk too much, is the same with that of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1816,"Mad-men: some of them Raging, others Loving, others laughing, all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1817,"extravagantly, but according to their severall domineering Passions:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1818,"For the effect of the wine, does but remove Dissimulation; and take from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1819,"them the sight of the deformity of their Passions. For, (I believe) the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1820,"most sober men, when they walk alone without care and employment of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1821,"mind, would be unwilling the vanity and Extravagance of their thoughts"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1822,"at that time should be publiquely seen: which is a confession, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1823,"Passions unguided, are for the most part meere Madnesse."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1824,"The opinions of the world, both in antient and later ages, concerning"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1825,"the cause of madnesse, have been two. Some, deriving them from the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1826,"Passions; some, from Daemons, or Spirits, either good, or bad, which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1827,"they thought might enter into a man, possesse him, and move his organs"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1828,"is such strange, and uncouth manner, as mad-men use to do. The former"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1829,"sort therefore, called such men, Mad-men: but the Later, called them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1830,"sometimes Daemoniacks, (that is, possessed with spirits;) sometimes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1831,"Energumeni, (that is agitated, or moved with spirits;) and now in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1832,"Italy they are called not onely Pazzi, Mad-men; but also Spiritati, men"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1833,possest.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1834,"There was once a great conflux of people in Abdera, a City of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1835,"Greeks, at the acting of the Tragedy of Andromeda, upon an extream hot"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1836,"day: whereupon, a great many of the spectators falling into Fevers, had"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1837,"this accident from the heat, and from The Tragedy together, that they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1838,"did nothing but pronounce Iambiques, with the names of Perseus and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1839,"Andromeda; which together with the Fever, was cured, by the comming on"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1840,of Winter: And this madnesse was thought to proceed from the Passion
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1841,imprinted by the Tragedy. Likewise there raigned a fit of madnesse in
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1842,"another Graecian city, which seized onely the young Maidens; and caused"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1843,many of them to hang themselves. This was by most then thought an act of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1844,"the Divel. But one that suspected, that contempt of life in them,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1845,"might proceed from some Passion of the mind, and supposing they did not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1846,"contemne also their honour, gave counsell to the Magistrates, to strip"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1847,"such as so hang'd themselves, and let them hang out naked. This the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1848,"story sayes cured that madnesse. But on the other side, the same"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1849,"Graecians, did often ascribe madnesse, to the operation of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1850,"Eumenides, or Furyes; and sometimes of Ceres, Phoebus, and other Gods:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1851,"so much did men attribute to Phantasmes, as to think them aereal living"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1852,"bodies; and generally to call them Spirits. And as the Romans in this,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1853,held the same opinion with the Greeks: so also did the Jewes; For they
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1854,"calle mad-men Prophets, or (according as they thought the spirits"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1855,"good or bad) Daemoniacks; and some of them called both Prophets, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1856,"Daemoniacks, mad-men; and some called the same man both Daemoniack, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1857,"mad-man. But for the Gentiles, 'tis no wonder; because Diseases, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1858,"Health; Vices, and Vertues; and many naturall accidents, were with them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1859,"termed, and worshipped as Daemons. So that a man was to understand by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1860,"Daemon, as well (sometimes) an Ague, as a Divell. But for the Jewes to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1861,"have such opinion, is somewhat strange. For neither Moses, nor Abraham"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1862,pretended to Prophecy by possession of a Spirit; but from the voyce of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1863,"God; or by a Vision or Dream: Nor is there any thing in his Law,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1864,"Morall, or Ceremoniall, by which they were taught, there was any such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1865,"Enthusiasme; or any Possession. When God is sayd, (Numb. 11. 25.) to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1866,"take from the Spirit that was in Moses, and give it to the 70. Elders,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1867,the Spirit of God (taking it for the substance of God) is not divided.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1868,"The Scriptures by the Spirit of God in man, mean a mans spirit, enclined"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1869,"to Godlinesse. And where it is said (Exod. 28. 3.) ""Whom I have filled"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1870,"with the Spirit of wisdome to make garments for Aaron,"" is not meant a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1871,"spirit put into them, that can make garments; but the wisdome of their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1872,"own spirits in that kind of work. In the like sense, the spirit of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1873,"man, when it produceth unclean actions, is ordinarily called an unclean"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1874,"spirit; and so other spirits, though not alwayes, yet as often as the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1875,"vertue or vice so stiled, is extraordinary, and Eminent. Neither did the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1876,"other Prophets of the old Testament pretend Enthusiasme; or, that God"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1877,"spake in them; but to them by Voyce, Vision, or Dream; and the Burthen"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1878,"Of The Lord was not Possession, but Command. How then could the Jewes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1879,"fall into this opinion of possession? I can imagine no reason, but that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1880,"which is common to all men; namely, the want of curiosity to search"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1881,"naturall causes; and their placing Felicity, in the acquisition of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1882,"grosse pleasures of the Senses, and the things that most immediately"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1883,"conduce thereto. For they that see any strange, and unusuall ability, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1884,"defect in a mans mind; unlesse they see withall, from what cause it may"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1885,"probably proceed, can hardly think it naturall; and if not naturall,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1886,"they must needs thinke it supernaturall; and then what can it be, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1887,"that either God, or the Divell is in him? And hence it came to passe,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1888,"when our Saviour (Mark 3.21.) was compassed about with the multitude,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1889,"those of the house doubted he was mad, and went out to hold him: but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1890,"the Scribes said he had Belzebub, and that was it, by which he cast out"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1891,divels; as if the greater mad-man had awed the lesser. And that (John
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1892,"10. 20.) some said, ""He hath a Divell, and is mad;"" whereas others"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1893,"holding him for a Prophet, sayd, ""These are not the words of one that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1894,"hath a Divell."" So in the old Testament he that came to anoynt Jehu, (2"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1895,"Kings 9.11.) was a Prophet; but some of the company asked Jehu, ""What"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1896,"came that mad-man for?"" So that in summe, it is manifest, that whosoever"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1897,"behaved himselfe in extraordinary manner, was thought by the Jewes to be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1898,"possessed either with a good, or evill spirit; except by the Sadduces,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1899,"who erred so farre on the other hand, as not to believe there were at"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1900,"all any spirits, (which is very neere to direct Atheisme;) and thereby"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1901,"perhaps the more provoked others, to terme such men Daemoniacks, rather"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1902,than mad-men.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1903,"But why then does our Saviour proceed in the curing of them, as if they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1904,were possest; and not as if they were mad. To which I can give no other
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1905,"kind of answer, but that which is given to those that urge the Scripture"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1906,in like manner against the opinion of the motion of the Earth. The
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1907,Scripture was written to shew unto men the kingdome of God; and to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1908,prepare their mindes to become his obedient subjects; leaving the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1909,"world, and the Philosophy thereof, to the disputation of men, for the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1910,"exercising of their naturall Reason. Whether the Earths, or Suns motion"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1911,"make the day, and night; or whether the Exorbitant actions of men,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1912,"proceed from Passion, or from the Divell, (so we worship him not) it is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1913,"all one, as to our obedience, and subjection to God Almighty; which is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1914,the thing for which the Scripture was written. As for that our Saviour
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1915,"speaketh to the disease, as to a person; it is the usuall phrase of all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1916,"that cure by words onely, as Christ did, (and Inchanters pretend to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1917,"do, whether they speak to a Divel or not.) For is not Christ also said"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1918,(Math. 8.26.) to have rebuked the winds? Is not he said also (Luk. 4.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1919,39.) to rebuke a Fever? Yet this does not argue that a Fever is a Divel.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1920,And whereas many of these Divels are said to confesse Christ; it is not
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1921,"necessary to interpret those places otherwise, than that those mad-men"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1922,confessed him. And whereas our Saviour (Math. 12. 43.) speaketh of an
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1923,"unclean Spirit, that having gone out of a man, wandreth through dry"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1924,"places, seeking rest, and finding none; and returning into the same"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1925,"man, with seven other spirits worse than himselfe; It is manifestly a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1926,"Parable, alluding to a man, that after a little endeavour to quit his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1927,"lusts, is vanquished by the strength of them; and becomes seven times"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1928,"worse than he was. So that I see nothing at all in the Scripture, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1929,"requireth a beliefe, that Daemoniacks were any other thing but Mad-men."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1930,Insignificant Speech
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1931,There is yet another fault in the Discourses of some men; which may also
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1932,"be numbred amongst the sorts of Madnesse; namely, that abuse of words,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1933,"whereof I have spoken before in the fifth chapter, by the Name of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1934,"Absurdity. And that is, when men speak such words, as put together, have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1935,"in them no signification at all; but are fallen upon by some, through"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1936,"misunderstanding of the words they have received, and repeat by rote; by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1937,"others, from intention to deceive by obscurity. And this is incident to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1938,"none but those, that converse in questions of matters incomprehensible,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1939,as the Schoole-men; or in questions of abstruse Philosophy. The common
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1940,"sort of men seldome speak Insignificantly, and are therefore, by those"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1941,other Egregious persons counted Idiots. But to be assured their words
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1942,"are without any thing correspondent to them in the mind, there would"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1943,"need some Examples; which if any man require, let him take a Schoole-man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1944,"into his hands, and see if he can translate any one chapter concerning"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1945,any difficult point; as the Trinity; the Deity; the nature of Christ;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1946,"Transubstantiation; Free-will. &c. into any of the moderne tongues, so"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1947,"as to make the same intelligible; or into any tolerable Latine, such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1948,"as they were acquainted withall, that lived when the Latine tongue was"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1949,"Vulgar. What is the meaning of these words. ""The first cause does not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1950,"necessarily inflow any thing into the second, by force of the Essential"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1951,"subordination of the second causes, by which it may help it to worke?"""

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1953,"first Booke, Of The Concourse, Motion, And Help Of God. When men write"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1954,"whole volumes of such stuffe, are they not Mad, or intend to make others"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1955,"so? And particularly, in the question of Transubstantiation; where"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1956,"after certain words spoken, they that say, the White-nesse, Round-nesse,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1957,"Magni-tude, Quali-ty, Corruptibili-ty, all which are incorporeall, &c."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1958,"go out of the Wafer, into the Body of our blessed Saviour, do they not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1959,"make those Nesses, Tudes and Ties, to be so many spirits possessing his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1960,"body? For by Spirits, they mean alwayes things, that being incorporeall,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1961,are neverthelesse moveable from one place to another. So that this kind
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1962,"of Absurdity, may rightly be numbred amongst the many sorts of Madnesse;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1963,"and all the time that guided by clear Thoughts of their worldly lust,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1964,"they forbear disputing, or writing thus, but Lucide Intervals. And thus"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,8,1965,much of the Vertues and Defects Intellectuall.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,9,1966,CHAPTER IX. OF THE SEVERALL SUBJECTS OF KNOWLEDGE
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,9,1967,There are of KNOWLEDGE two kinds; whereof one is Knowledge Of Fact: the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,9,1968,other Knowledge Of The Consequence Of One Affirmation To Another. The
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,9,1969,"former is nothing else, but Sense and Memory, and is Absolute Knowledge;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,9,1970,"as when we see a Fact doing, or remember it done: And this is the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,9,1971,Knowledge required in a Witnesse. The later is called Science; and is
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,9,1972,"Conditionall; as when we know, that, If The Figure Showne Be A Circle,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,9,1973,Then Any Straight Line Through The Centre Shall Divide It Into Two
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,9,1974,Equall Parts. And this is the Knowledge required in a Philosopher; that
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,9,1975,"is to say, of him that pretends to Reasoning."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,9,1976,The Register of Knowledge Of Fact is called History. Whereof there be
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,9,1977,two sorts: one called Naturall History; which is the History of such
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,9,1978,"Facts, or Effects of Nature, as have no Dependance on Mans Will; Such as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,9,1979,"are the Histories of Metals, Plants, Animals, Regions, and the like. The"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,9,1980,"other, is Civill History; which is the History of the Voluntary Actions"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,9,1981,of men in Common-wealths.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,9,1982,"The Registers of Science, are such Books as contain the Demonstrations"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,9,1983,"of Consequences of one Affirmation, to another; and are commonly called"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,9,1984,"Books of Philosophy; whereof the sorts are many, according to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,9,1985,diversity of the Matter; And may be divided in such manner as I have

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2066,Power
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2067,"The POWER of a Man, (to take it Universally,) is his present means,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2068,"to obtain some future apparent Good. And is either Originall, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2069,Instrumentall.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2070,"Naturall Power, is the eminence of the Faculties of Body, or Mind: as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2071,"extraordinary Strength, Forme, Prudence, Arts, Eloquence, Liberality,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2072,"Nobility. Instrumentall are those Powers, which acquired by these, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2073,"by fortune, are means and Instruments to acquire more: as Riches,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2074,"Reputation, Friends, and the Secret working of God, which men call"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2075,"Good Luck. For the nature of Power, is in this point, like to Fame,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2076,"increasing as it proceeds; or like the motion of heavy bodies, which the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2077,"further they go, make still the more hast."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2078,"The Greatest of humane Powers, is that which is compounded of the Powers"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2079,"of most men, united by consent, in one person, Naturall, or civill, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2080,has the use of all their Powers depending on his will; such as is the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2081,Power of a Common-wealth: or depending on the wills of each particular;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2082,"such as is the Power of a Faction, or of divers factions leagued."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2083,"Therefore to have servants, is Power; To have Friends, is Power: for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2084,they are strengths united.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2085,"Also Riches joyned with liberality, is Power; because it procureth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2086,"friends, and servants: Without liberality, not so; because in this case"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2087,"they defend not; but expose men to Envy, as a Prey."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2088,"Reputation of power, is Power; because it draweth with it the adhaerance"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2104,Power.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2105,Eloquence is Power; because it is seeming Prudence.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2106,"Forme is Power; because being a promise of Good, it recommendeth men to"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2113,"Instruments of War; because they conferre to Defence, and Victory,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2114,"are Power; And though the true Mother of them, be Science, namely the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2115,"Mathematiques; yet, because they are brought into the Light, by the hand"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2116,"of the Artificer, they be esteemed (the Midwife passing with the vulgar"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2117,"for the Mother,) as his issue."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2118,Worth
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2119,"The Value, or WORTH of a man, is as of all other things, his Price;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2120,"that is to say, so much as would be given for the use of his Power:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2121,and therefore is not absolute; but a thing dependant on the need and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2122,"judgement of another. An able conductor of Souldiers, is of great Price"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2123,"in time of War present, or imminent; but in Peace not so. A learned and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2124,"uncorrupt Judge, is much Worth in time of Peace; but not so much in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2125,"War. And as in other things, so in men, not the seller, but the buyer"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2126,"determines the Price. For let a man (as most men do,) rate themselves as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2127,the highest Value they can; yet their true Value is no more than it is
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2128,esteemed by others.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2129,"The manifestation of the Value we set on one another, is that which is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2130,"commonly called Honouring, and Dishonouring. To Value a man at a high"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2131,"rate, is to Honour him; at a low rate, is to Dishonour him. But high,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2132,"and low, in this case, is to be understood by comparison to the rate"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2133,that each man setteth on himselfe.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2134,Dignity
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2135,"The publique worth of a man, which is the Value set on him by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2136,"Common-wealth, is that which men commonly call DIGNITY. And this Value"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2137,"of him by the Common-wealth, is understood, by offices of Command,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2138,"Judicature, publike Employment; or by Names and Titles, introduced for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2139,distinction of such Value.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2140,To Honour and Dishonour
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2141,"To pray to another, for ayde of any kind, is to HONOUR; because a signe"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2142,we have an opinion he has power to help; and the more difficult the ayde
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2143,"is, the more is the Honour."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2144,"To obey, is to Honour; because no man obeyes them, whom they think"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2145,"have no power to help, or hurt them. And consequently to disobey, is to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2146,Dishonour.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2147,"To give great gifts to a man, is to Honour him; because 'tis buying"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2148,"of Protection, and acknowledging of Power. To give little gifts, is to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2149,"Dishonour; because it is but Almes, and signifies an opinion of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2150,need of small helps. To be sedulous in promoting anothers good; also
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2151,"to flatter, is to Honour; as a signe we seek his protection or ayde. To"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2152,"neglect, is to Dishonour."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2153,"To give way, or place to another, in any Commodity, is to Honour; being"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2154,"a confession of greater power. To arrogate, is to Dishonour."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2155,"To shew any signe of love, or feare of another, is to Honour; for both"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2156,"to love, and to feare, is to value. To contemne, or lesse to love or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2157,"feare then he expects, is to Dishonour; for 'tis undervaluing."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2158,"To praise, magnifie, or call happy, is to Honour; because nothing but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2159,"goodnesse, power, and felicity is valued. To revile, mock, or pitty, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2160,to Dishonour.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2161,"To speak to another with consideration, to appear before him with"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2162,"decency, and humility, is to Honour him; as signes of fear to offend."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2163,"To speak to him rashly, to do anything before him obscenely, slovenly,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2164,"impudently, is to Dishonour."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2165,"To believe, to trust, to rely on another, is to Honour him; signe of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2166,"opinion of his vertue and power. To distrust, or not believe, is to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2167,Dishonour.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2168,"To hearken to a mans counsell, or discourse of what kind soever, is to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2169,"Honour; as a signe we think him wise, or eloquent, or witty. To sleep,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2170,"or go forth, or talk the while, is to Dishonour."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2171,"To do those things to another, which he takes for signes of Honour, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2172,"which the Law or Custome makes so, is to Honour; because in approving"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2173,"the Honour done by others, he acknowledgeth the power which others"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2174,"acknowledge. To refuse to do them, is to Dishonour."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2175,"To agree with in opinion, is to Honour; as being a signe of approving"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2176,"his judgement, and wisdome. To dissent, is Dishonour; and an upbraiding"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2177,of errour; and (if the dissent be in many things) of folly.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2178,"To imitate, is to Honour; for it is vehemently to approve. To imitate"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2179,"ones Enemy, is to Dishonour."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2180,"To honour those another honours, is to Honour him; as a signe of"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2185,"the same cases, to those that seek it, is to Dishonour."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2186,"All these wayes of Honouring, are naturall; and as well within, as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2187,"without Common-wealths. But in Common-wealths, where he, or they that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2188,"have the supreme Authority, can make whatsoever they please, to stand"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2189,"for signes of Honour, there be other Honours."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2190,"A Soveraigne doth Honour a Subject, with whatsoever Title, or Office, or"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2200,the Kings foole; and then it was Dishonour. So that of Civill Honour;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2201,"such as are Magistracy, Offices, Titles; and in some places Coats, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2202,"Scutchions painted: and men Honour such as have them, as having so many"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2203,signes of favour in the Common-wealth; which favour is Power.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2204,"Honourable is whatsoever possession, action, or quality, is an argument"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2205,and signe of Power.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2206,"And therefore To be Honoured, loved, or feared of many, is Honourable;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2207,"as arguments of Power. To be Honoured of few or none, Dishonourable."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2208,"Good fortune (if lasting,) Honourable; as a signe of the favour of God."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2209,"Ill fortune, and losses, Dishonourable. Riches, are Honourable; for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2210,"they are Power. Poverty, Dishonourable. Magnanimity, Liberality,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2211,"Hope, Courage, Confidence, are Honourable; for they proceed from the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2212,"conscience of Power. Pusillanimity, Parsimony, Fear, Diffidence, are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2213,Dishonourable.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2214,"Timely Resolution, or determination of what a man is to do, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2215,"Honourable; as being the contempt of small difficulties, and dangers."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2216,"And Irresolution, Dishonourable; as a signe of too much valuing of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2217,"little impediments, and little advantages: For when a man has weighed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2218,"things as long as the time permits, and resolves not, the difference"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2219,"of weight is but little; and therefore if he resolve not, he overvalues"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2220,"little things, which is Pusillanimity."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2221,"All Actions, and Speeches, that proceed, or seem to proceed from much"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2222,"Experience, Science, Discretion, or Wit, are Honourable; For all these"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2223,"are Powers. Actions, or Words that proceed from Errour, Ignorance, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2224,"Folly, Dishonourable."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2225,"Gravity, as farre forth as it seems to proceed from a mind employed on"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2226,"some thing else, is Honourable; because employment is a signe of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2227,"Power. But if it seem to proceed from a purpose to appear grave, it is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2228,"Dishonourable. For the gravity of the Former, is like the steddinesse of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2229,"a Ship laden with Merchandise; but of the later, like the steddinesse of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2230,"a Ship ballasted with Sand, and other trash."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2231,"To be Conspicuous, that is to say, to be known, for Wealth, Office,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2232,"great Actions, or any eminent Good, is Honourable; as a signe of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2233,"power for which he is conspicuous. On the contrary, Obscurity, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2234,Dishonourable.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2235,"To be descended from conspicuous Parents, is Honourable; because they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2236,"the more easily attain the aydes, and friends of their Ancestors. On the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2237,"contrary, to be descended from obscure Parentage, is Dishonourable."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2238,"Actions proceeding from Equity, joyned with losse, are Honourable;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2239,as signes of Magnanimity: for Magnanimity is a signe of Power. On the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2240,"contrary, Craft, Shifting, neglect of Equity, is Dishonourable."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2241,"Nor does it alter the case of Honour, whether an action (so it be great"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2242,"and difficult, and consequently a signe of much power,) be just or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2243,unjust: for Honour consisteth onely in the opinion of Power. Therefore
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2244,"the ancient Heathen did not thinke they Dishonoured, but greatly"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2245,"Honoured the Gods, when they introduced them in their Poems, committing"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2246,"Rapes, Thefts, and other great, but unjust, or unclean acts: In so much"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2247,"as nothing is so much celebrated in Jupiter, as his Adulteries; nor"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2248,"in Mercury, as his Frauds, and Thefts: of whose praises, in a hymne"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2249,"of Homer, the greatest is this, that being born in the morning, he had"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2250,"invented Musique at noon, and before night, stolen away the Cattell of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2251,"Appollo, from his Herdsmen."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2252,"Also amongst men, till there were constituted great Common-wealths,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2253,"it was thought no dishonour to be a Pyrate, or a High-way Theefe; but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2254,"rather a lawfull Trade, not onely amongst the Greeks, but also amongst"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2255,all other Nations; as is manifest by the Histories of antient time. And
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2256,"at this day, in this part of the world, private Duels are, and alwayes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2257,"will be Honourable, though unlawfull, till such time as there shall be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2258,"Honour ordained for them that refuse, and Ignominy for them that make"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2259,the Challenge. For Duels also are many times effects of Courage; and the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2260,"ground of Courage is alwayes Strength or Skill, which are Power; though"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2261,"for the most part they be effects of rash speaking, and of the fear of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2262,"Dishonour, in one, or both the Combatants; who engaged by rashnesse, are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2263,driven into the Lists to avoyd disgrace.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2264,"Scutchions, and coats of Armes haereditary, where they have any eminent"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2265,"Priviledges, are Honourable; otherwise not: for their Power consisteth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2266,"either in such Priviledges, or in Riches, or some such thing as is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2267,"equally honoured in other men. This kind of Honour, commonly called"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2268,"Gentry, has been derived from the Antient Germans. For there never was"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2269,"any such thing known, where the German Customes were unknown. Nor is it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2270,"now any where in use, where the Germans have not inhabited. The antient"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2271,"Greek Commanders, when they went to war, had their Shields painted with"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2272,such Devises as they pleased; insomuch as an unpainted Buckler was a
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2273,"signe of Poverty, and of a common Souldier: but they transmitted not the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2274,Inheritance of them. The Romans transmitted the Marks of their Families:
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2275,"but they were the Images, not the Devises of their Ancestors. Amongst"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2276,"the people of Asia, Afrique, and America, there is not, nor was ever,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2277,any such thing. The Germans onely had that custome; from whom it has
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2278,"been derived into England, France, Spain, and Italy, when in great"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2279,"numbers they either ayded the Romans, or made their own Conquests in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2280,these Westerne parts of the world.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2281,"For Germany, being antiently, as all other Countries, in their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2282,"beginnings, divided amongst an infinite number of little Lords, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2283,"Masters of Families, that continually had wars one with another; those"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2284,"Masters, or Lords, principally to the end they might, when they were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2285,"Covered with Arms, be known by their followers; and partly for ornament,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2286,"both painted their Armor, or their Scutchion, or Coat, with the picture"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2287,"of some Beast, or other thing; and also put some eminent and visible"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2288,mark upon the Crest of their Helmets. And his ornament both of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2289,"Armes, and Crest, descended by inheritance to their Children; to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2290,"eldest pure, and to the rest with some note of diversity, such as the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2291,"Old master, that is to say in Dutch, the Here-alt thought fit. But when"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2292,"many such Families, joyned together, made a greater Monarchy, this duty"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2293,"of the Herealt, to distinguish Scutchions, was made a private Office"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2294,"a part. And the issue of these Lords, is the great and antient Gentry;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2295,"which for the most part bear living creatures, noted for courage, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2296,"rapine; or Castles, Battlements, Belts, Weapons, Bars, Palisadoes, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2297,"other notes of War; nothing being then in honour, but vertue military."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2298,"Afterwards, not onely Kings, but popular Common-wealths, gave divers"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2299,"manners of Scutchions, to such as went forth to the War, or returned"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2300,"from it, for encouragement, or recompence to their service. All which,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2301,"by an observing Reader, may be found in such ancient Histories, Greek"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2302,"and Latine, as make mention of the German Nation, and Manners, in their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2303,times.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2304,Titles of Honour
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2305,"Titles of Honour, such as are Duke, Count, Marquis, and Baron, are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2306,Honourable; as signifying the value set upon them by the Soveraigne
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2307,"Power of the Common-wealth: Which Titles, were in old time titles"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2308,"of Office, and Command, derived some from the Romans, some from the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2309,"Germans, and French. Dukes, in Latine Duces, being Generalls in War:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2310,"Counts, Comites, such as bare the Generall company out of friendship;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2311,"and were left to govern and defend places conquered, and pacified:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2312,"Marquises, Marchiones, were Counts that governed the Marches, or bounds"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2313,"of the Empire. Which titles of Duke, Count, and Marquis, came into the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2314,"Empire, about the time of Constantine the Great, from the customes of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2315,"the German Militia. But Baron, seems to have been a Title of the Gaules,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2316,"and signifies a Great man; such as were the Kings, or Princes men, whom"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2317,they employed in war about their persons; and seems to be derived from
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2318,"Vir, to Ber, and Bar, that signified the same in the Language of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2319,"Gaules, that Vir in Latine; and thence to Bero, and Baro: so that such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2320,"men were called Berones, and after Barones; and (in Spanish) Varones."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2321,But he that would know more particularly the originall of Titles of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2322,"Honour, may find it, as I have done this, in Mr. Seldens most excellent"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2323,"Treatise of that subject. In processe of time these offices of Honour,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2324,"by occasion of trouble, and for reasons of good and peacable government,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2325,"were turned into meer Titles; serving for the most part, to distinguish"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2326,"the precedence, place, and order of subjects in the Common-wealth: and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2327,"men were made Dukes, Counts, Marquises, and Barons of Places, wherein"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2328,"they had neither possession, nor command: and other Titles also, were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2329,devised to the same end.

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2334,"ability, is usually named FITNESSE, or Aptitude."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2335,"For he is Worthiest to be a Commander, to be a Judge, or to have any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2336,"other charge, that is best fitted, with the qualities required to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2337,"well discharging of it; and Worthiest of Riches, that has the qualities"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2338,most requisite for the well using of them: any of which qualities being
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2339,"absent, one may neverthelesse be a Worthy man, and valuable for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2340,"some thing else. Again, a man may be Worthy of Riches, Office, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2341,"Employment, that neverthelesse, can plead no right to have it before"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2342,"another; and therefore cannot be said to merit or deserve it. For Merit,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2343,"praesupposeth a right, and that the thing deserved is due by promise: Of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,10,2344,"which I shall say more hereafter, when I shall speak of Contracts."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2345,CHAPTER XI. OF THE DIFFERENCE OF MANNERS
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2346,What Is Here Meant By Manners
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2347,"By MANNERS, I mean not here, Decency of behaviour; as how one man should"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2348,"salute another, or how a man should wash his mouth, or pick his teeth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2349,"before company, and such other points of the Small Morals; But those"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2350,"qualities of man-kind, that concern their living together in Peace, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2351,"Unity. To which end we are to consider, that the Felicity of this life,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2352,consisteth not in the repose of a mind satisfied. For there is no such
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2353,"Finis Ultimus, (utmost ayme,) nor Summum Bonum, (greatest good,) as is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2354,spoken of in the Books of the old Morall Philosophers. Nor can a man
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2355,"any more live, whose Desires are at an end, than he, whose Senses and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2356,Imaginations are at a stand. Felicity is a continuall progresse of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2357,"desire, from one object to another; the attaining of the former, being"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2358,"still but the way to the later. The cause whereof is, That the object"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2359,"of mans desire, is not to enjoy once onely, and for one instant of time;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2360,"but to assure for ever, the way of his future desire. And therefore the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2361,"voluntary actions, and inclinations of all men, tend, not only to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2362,"procuring, but also to the assuring of a contented life; and differ"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2363,"onely in the way: which ariseth partly from the diversity of passions,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2364,"in divers men; and partly from the difference of the knowledge, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2365,"opinion each one has of the causes, which produce the effect desired."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2366,"A Restlesse Desire Of Power, In All Men"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2367,"So that in the first place, I put for a generall inclination of all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2368,"mankind, a perpetuall and restlesse desire of Power after power, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2369,"ceaseth onely in Death. And the cause of this, is not alwayes that a man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2370,"hopes for a more intensive delight, than he has already attained to; or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2371,that he cannot be content with a moderate power: but because he cannot
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2372,"assure the power and means to live well, which he hath present, without"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2373,"the acquisition of more. And from hence it is, that Kings, whose power"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2374,"is greatest, turn their endeavours to the assuring it a home by Lawes,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2375,"or abroad by Wars: and when that is done, there succeedeth a new desire;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2376,"in some, of Fame from new Conquest; in others, of ease and sensuall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2377,"pleasure; in others, of admiration, or being flattered for excellence in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2378,"some art, or other ability of the mind."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2379,Love Of Contention From Competition
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2380,"Competition of Riches, Honour, command, or other power, enclineth to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2381,"Contention, Enmity, and War: because the way of one Competitor, to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2382,"attaining of his desire, is to kill, subdue, supplant, or repell the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2383,"other. Particularly, competition of praise, enclineth to a reverence of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2384,"Antiquity. For men contend with the living, not with the dead; to these"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2385,"ascribing more than due, that they may obscure the glory of the other."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2386,Civil Obedience From Love Of Ease
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2387,"Desire of Ease, and sensuall Delight, disposeth men to obey a common"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2388,"Power: because by such Desires, a man doth abandon the protection might"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2389,"be hoped for from his own Industry, and labour."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2390,From Feare Of Death Or Wounds
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2391,"Fear of Death, and Wounds, disposeth to the same; and for the same"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2392,"reason. On the contrary, needy men, and hardy, not contented with their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2393,"present condition; as also, all men that are ambitious of Military"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2394,"command, are enclined to continue the causes of warre; and to stirre up"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2395,trouble and sedition: for there is no honour Military but by warre; nor
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2396,"any such hope to mend an ill game, as by causing a new shuffle."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2397,And From Love Of Arts
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2398,"Desire of Knowledge, and Arts of Peace, enclineth men to obey a common"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2399,"Power: For such Desire, containeth a desire of leasure; and consequently"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2400,protection from some other Power than their own.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2401,"Love Of Vertue, From Love Of Praise"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2402,"Desire of Praise, disposeth to laudable actions, such as please them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2403,"whose judgement they value; for of these men whom we contemn, we contemn"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2404,also the Praises. Desire of Fame after death does the same. And though
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2405,"after death, there be no sense of the praise given us on Earth, as being"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2406,"joyes, that are either swallowed up in the unspeakable joyes of Heaven,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2407,or extinguished in the extreme torments of Hell: yet is not such Fame
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2408,"vain; because men have a present delight therein, from the foresight"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2409,"of it, and of the benefit that may rebound thereby to their posterity:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2410,"which though they now see not, yet they imagine; and any thing that is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2411,"pleasure in the sense, the same also is pleasure in the imagination."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2412,"Hate, From Difficulty Of Requiting Great Benefits"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2413,"To have received from one, to whom we think our selves equall, greater"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2414,"benefits than there is hope to Requite, disposeth to counterfiet love;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2415,but really secret hatred; and puts a man into the estate of a desperate
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2416,"debtor, that in declining the sight of his creditor, tacitely wishes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2417,"him there, where he might never see him more. For benefits oblige; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2418,"obligation is thraldome; which is to ones equall, hateful. But to have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2419,"received benefits from one, whom we acknowledge our superiour, enclines"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2420,to love; because the obligation is no new depession: and cheerfull
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2421,"acceptation, (which men call Gratitude,) is such an honour done to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2422,"the obliger, as is taken generally for retribution. Also to receive"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2423,"benefits, though from an equall, or inferiour, as long as there is hope"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2424,"of requitall, disposeth to love: for in the intention of the receiver,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2425,"the obligation is of ayd, and service mutuall; from whence proceedeth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2426,an Emulation of who shall exceed in benefiting; the most noble and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2427,profitable contention possible; wherein the victor is pleased with his
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2428,"victory, and the other revenged by confessing it."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2429,And From Conscience Of Deserving To Be Hated
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2430,"To have done more hurt to a man, than he can, or is willing to expiate,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2431,"enclineth the doer to hate the sufferer. For he must expect revenge, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2432,forgivenesse; both which are hatefull.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2433,"Promptnesse To Hurt, From Fear"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2434,"Feare of oppression, disposeth a man to anticipate, or to seek ayd by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2435,society: for there is no other way by which a man can secure his life
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2436,and liberty.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2437,And From Distrust Of Their Own Wit
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2438,"Men that distrust their own subtilty, are in tumult, and sedition,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2439,"better disposed for victory, than they that suppose themselves wise,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2440,"or crafty. For these love to consult, the other (fearing to be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2441,"circumvented,) to strike first. And in sedition, men being alwayes in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2442,"the procincts of Battell, to hold together, and use all advantages of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2443,"force, is a better stratagem, than any that can proceed from subtilty of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2444,Wit.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2445,Vain Undertaking From Vain-glory
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2446,"Vain-glorious men, such as without being conscious to themselves of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2447,"great sufficiency, delight in supposing themselves gallant men, are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2448,enclined onely to ostentation; but not to attempt: Because when
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2449,"danger or difficulty appears, they look for nothing but to have their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2450,insufficiency discovered.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2451,"Vain-glorious men, such as estimate their sufficiency by the flattery"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2452,"of other men, or the fortune of some precedent action, without assured"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2453,"ground of hope from the true knowledge of themselves, are enclined to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2454,"rash engaging; and in the approach of danger, or difficulty, to retire"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2455,"if they can: because not seeing the way of safety, they will rather"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2456,"hazard their honour, which may be salved with an excuse; than their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2457,"lives, for which no salve is sufficient."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2458,"Ambition, From Opinion Of Sufficiency"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2459,Men that have a strong opinion of their own wisdome in matter of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2460,"government, are disposed to Ambition. Because without publique"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2461,"Employment in counsell or magistracy, the honour of their wisdome is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2462,lost. And therefore Eloquent speakers are enclined to Ambition; for
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2463,"Eloquence seemeth wisdome, both to themselves and others"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2464,"Irresolution, From Too Great Valuing Of Small Matters"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2465,"Pusillanimity disposeth men to Irresolution, and consequently to lose"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2466,"the occasions, and fittest opportunities of action. For after men have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2467,"been in deliberation till the time of action approach, if it be not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2468,"then manifest what is best to be done, tis a signe, the difference of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2469,"Motives, the one way and the other, are not great: Therefore not to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2470,"resolve then, is to lose the occasion by weighing of trifles; which is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2471,pusillanimity.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2472,"Frugality,(though in poor men a Vertue,) maketh a man unapt to atchieve"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2473,"such actions, as require the strength of many men at once: For it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2474,"weakeneth their Endeavour, which is to be nourished and kept in vigor by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2475,Reward.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2476,Confidence In Others From Ignorance Of The Marks Of Wisdome and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2477,"Kindnesse Eloquence, with flattery, disposeth men to confide in them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2478,"that have it; because the former is seeming Wisdome, the later seeming"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2479,"Kindnesse. Adde to them Military reputation, and it disposeth men to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2480,"adhaere, and subject themselves to those men that have them. The two"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2481,"former, having given them caution against danger from him; the later"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2482,gives them caution against danger from others.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2483,And From The Ignorance Of Naturall Causes
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2484,"Want of Science, that is, Ignorance of causes, disposeth, or rather"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2485,"constraineth a man to rely on the advise, and authority of others. For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2486,"all men whom the truth concernes, if they rely not on their own,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2487,"must rely on the opinion of some other, whom they think wiser than"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2488,"themselves, and see not why he should deceive them."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2489,And From Want Of Understanding
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2490,"Ignorance of the signification of words; which is, want of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2491,"understanding, disposeth men to take on trust, not onely the truth they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2492,"know not; but also the errors; and which is more, the non-sense of them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2493,"they trust: For neither Error, nor non-sense, can without a perfect"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2494,"understanding of words, be detected."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2495,"From the same it proceedeth, that men give different names, to one and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2496,"the same thing, from the difference of their own passions: As they that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2497,"approve a private opinion, call it Opinion; but they that mislike it,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2498,Haeresie: and yet haeresie signifies no more than private opinion; but
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2499,has onely a greater tincture of choler.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2500,"From the same also it proceedeth, that men cannot distinguish, without"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2501,"study and great understanding, between one action of many men, and many"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2502,"actions of one multitude; as for example, between the one action of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2503,"all the Senators of Rome in killing Catiline, and the many actions of a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2504,number of Senators in killing Caesar; and therefore are disposed to take
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2505,"for the action of the people, that which is a multitude of actions done"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2506,"by a multitude of men, led perhaps by the perswasion of one."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2507,"Adhaerence To Custome, From Ignorance Of The Nature Of Right And Wrong"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2508,"Ignorance of the causes, and originall constitution of Right, Equity,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2509,"Law, and Justice, disposeth a man to make Custome and Example the rule"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2510,"of his actions; in such manner, as to think that Unjust which it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2511,"hath been the custome to punish; and that Just, of the impunity and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2512,"approbation whereof they can produce an Example, or (as the Lawyers"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2516,"Masters; save that children are constant to their rule, whereas men are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2517,"not so; because grown strong, and stubborn, they appeale from custome"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2518,"to reason, and from reason to custome, as it serves their turn; receding"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2519,"from custome when their interest requires it, and setting themselves"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2520,"against reason, as oft as reason is against them: Which is the cause,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2521,"that the doctrine of Right and Wrong, is perpetually disputed, both by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2522,"the Pen and the Sword: whereas the doctrine of Lines, and Figures, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2523,"not so; because men care not, in that subject what be truth, as a thing"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2524,"that crosses no mans ambition, profit, or lust. For I doubt not, but if"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2525,"it had been a thing contrary to any mans right of dominion, or to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2526,"interest of men that have dominion, That The Three Angles Of A Triangle"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2527,Should Be Equall To Two Angles Of A Square; that doctrine should have
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2528,"been, if not disputed, yet by the burning of all books of Geometry,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2529,"suppressed, as farre as he whom it concerned was able."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2530,"Adhaerence To Private Men, From Ignorance Of The Causes Of Peace"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2531,"Ignorance of remote causes, disposeth men to attribute all events, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2532,"the causes immediate, and Instrumentall: For these are all the causes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2533,"they perceive. And hence it comes to passe, that in all places, men that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2534,"are grieved with payments to the Publique, discharge their anger upon"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2535,"the Publicans, that is to say, Farmers, Collectors, and other Officers"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2536,of the publique Revenue; and adhaere to such as find fault with the

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2540,Credulity From Ignorance Of Nature
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2541,"Ignorance of naturall causes disposeth a man to Credulity, so as"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2543,"the contrary, but that they may be true; being unable to detect the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2544,"Impossibility. And Credulity, because men love to be hearkened unto in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2545,"company, disposeth them to lying: so that Ignorance it selfe without"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2552,"Naturall Religion, From The Same"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2553,"Curiosity, or love of the knowledge of causes, draws a man from"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2559,there is one God Eternall; though they cannot have any Idea of him in
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2560,"their mind, answerable to his nature. For as a man that is born blind,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2561,"hearing men talk of warming themselves by the fire, and being brought"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2562,"to warm himself by the same, may easily conceive, and assure himselfe,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2563,"there is somewhat there, which men call Fire, and is the cause of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2564,heat he feeles; but cannot imagine what it is like; nor have an Idea of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2565,"it in his mind, such as they have that see it: so also, by the visible"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2566,"things of this world, and their admirable order, a man may conceive"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2567,"there is a cause of them, which men call God; and yet not have an Idea,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2568,or Image of him in his mind.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2569,"And they that make little, or no enquiry into the naturall causes of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2570,"things, yet from the feare that proceeds from the ignorance it selfe,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2571,"of what it is that hath the power to do them much good or harm, are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2572,"enclined to suppose, and feign unto themselves, severall kinds of Powers"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2573,Invisible; and to stand in awe of their own imaginations; and in time
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2574,of distresse to invoke them; as also in the time of an expected good
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2575,"successe, to give them thanks; making the creatures of their own"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2576,"fancy, their Gods. By which means it hath come to passe, that from the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2577,"innumerable variety of Fancy, men have created in the world innumerable"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2578,"sorts of Gods. And this Feare of things invisible, is the naturall Seed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2579,"of that, which every one in himself calleth Religion; and in them that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2580,"worship, or feare that Power otherwise than they do, Superstition."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2581,"And this seed of Religion, having been observed by many; some of those"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2582,"that have observed it, have been enclined thereby to nourish, dresse,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2583,"and forme it into Lawes; and to adde to it of their own invention,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2584,"any opinion of the causes of future events, by which they thought they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2585,"should best be able to govern others, and make unto themselves the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,11,2586,greatest use of their Powers.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2587,CHAPTER XII. OF RELIGION
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2588,"Religion, In Man Onely"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2589,"Seeing there are no signes, nor fruit of Religion, but in Man onely;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2590,"there is no cause to doubt, but that the seed of Religion, is also onely"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2591,"in Man; and consisteth in some peculiar quality, or at least in some"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2592,"eminent degree thereof, not to be found in other Living creatures."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2593,"First, From His Desire Of Knowing Causes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2594,"And first, it is peculiar to the nature of Man, to be inquisitive into"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2595,"the Causes of the Events they see, some more, some lesse; but all men so"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2596,"much, as to be curious in the search of the causes of their own good and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2597,evill fortune.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2598,From The Consideration Of The Beginning Of Things
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2599,"Secondly, upon the sight of any thing that hath a Beginning, to think"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2600,"also it had a cause, which determined the same to begin, then when it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2601,"did, rather than sooner or later."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2602,From His Observation Of The Sequell Of Things
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2603,"Thirdly, whereas there is no other Felicity of Beasts, but the enjoying"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2604,"of their quotidian Food, Ease, and Lusts; as having little, or no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2605,"foresight of the time to come, for want of observation, and memory"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2606,"of the order, consequence, and dependance of the things they see; Man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2607,observeth how one Event hath been produced by another; and remembreth in
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2608,them Antecedence and Consequence; And when he cannot assure himselfe of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2609,"the true causes of things, (for the causes of good and evill fortune for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2610,"the most part are invisible,) he supposes causes of them, either such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2611,"as his own fancy suggesteth; or trusteth to the Authority of other men,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2612,"such as he thinks to be his friends, and wiser than himselfe."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2613,"The Naturall Cause Of Religion, The Anxiety Of The Time To Come The"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2614,"two first, make Anxiety. For being assured that there be causes of all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2615,"things that have arrived hitherto, or shall arrive hereafter; it is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2616,"impossible for a man, who continually endeavoureth to secure himselfe"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2617,"against the evill he feares, and procure the good he desireth, not to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2618,"be in a perpetuall solicitude of the time to come; So that every man,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2619,"especially those that are over provident, are in an estate like to that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2620,"of Prometheus. For as Prometheus, (which interpreted, is, The Prudent"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2621,"Man,) was bound to the hill Caucasus, a place of large prospect, where,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2622,"an Eagle feeding on his liver, devoured in the day, as much as was"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2623,"repayred in the night: So that man, which looks too far before him, in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2624,"the care of future time, hath his heart all the day long, gnawed on by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2625,"feare of death, poverty, or other calamity; and has no repose, nor pause"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2626,"of his anxiety, but in sleep."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2627,Which Makes Them Fear The Power Of Invisible Things
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2628,"This perpetuall feare, alwayes accompanying mankind in the ignorance of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2629,"causes, as it were in the Dark, must needs have for object something."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2630,"And therefore when there is nothing to be seen, there is nothing to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2631,"accuse, either of their good, or evill fortune, but some Power, or Agent"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2632,"Invisible: In which sense perhaps it was, that some of the old Poets"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2633,"said, that the Gods were at first created by humane Feare: which spoken"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2634,"of the Gods, (that is to say, of the many Gods of the Gentiles) is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2635,"very true. But the acknowledging of one God Eternall, Infinite, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2636,"Omnipotent, may more easily be derived, from the desire men have to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2637,"know the causes of naturall bodies, and their severall vertues, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2638,operations; than from the feare of what was to befall them in time to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2639,"come. For he that from any effect hee seeth come to passe, should reason"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2640,"to the next and immediate cause thereof, and from thence to the cause"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2641,"of that cause, and plonge himselfe profoundly in the pursuit of causes;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2642,"shall at last come to this, that there must be (as even the Heathen"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2643,"Philosophers confessed) one First Mover; that is, a First, and an"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2644,Eternall cause of all things; which is that which men mean by the name
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2645,of God: And all this without thought of their fortune; the solicitude
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2646,"whereof, both enclines to fear, and hinders them from the search of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2647,causes of other things; and thereby gives occasion of feigning of as
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2648,"many Gods, as there be men that feigne them."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2649,And Suppose Them Incorporeall
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2650,"And for the matter, or substance of the Invisible Agents, so fancyed;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2651,"they could not by naturall cogitation, fall upon any other conceipt, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2652,that it was the same with that of the Soule of man; and that the Soule
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2653,"of man, was of the same substance, with that which appeareth in a Dream,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2654,"to one that sleepeth; or in a Looking-glasse, to one that is awake;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2655,"which, men not knowing that such apparitions are nothing else but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2656,"creatures of the Fancy, think to be reall, and externall Substances;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2657,"and therefore call them Ghosts; as the Latines called them Imagines,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2658,"and Umbrae; and thought them Spirits, that is, thin aereall bodies; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2659,"those Invisible Agents, which they feared, to bee like them; save that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2660,"they appear, and vanish when they please. But the opinion that such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2661,"Spirits were Incorporeall, or Immateriall, could never enter into the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2662,"mind of any man by nature; because, though men may put together words of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2663,"contradictory signification, as Spirit, and Incorporeall; yet they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2664,can never have the imagination of any thing answering to them:
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2665,"And therefore, men that by their own meditation, arrive to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2666,"acknowledgement of one Infinite, Omnipotent, and Eternall God,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2667,"choose rather to confesse he is Incomprehensible, and above their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2668,"understanding; than to define his Nature By Spirit Incorporeall, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2669,then Confesse their definition to be unintelligible: or if they give him
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2670,"such a title, it is not Dogmatically, with intention to make the Divine"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2671,"Nature understood; but Piously, to honour him with attributes, of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2672,"significations, as remote as they can from the grossenesse of Bodies"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2673,Visible.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2674,But Know Not The Way How They Effect Anything
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2675,"Then, for the way by which they think these Invisible Agents wrought"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2676,"their effects; that is to say, what immediate causes they used, in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2677,"bringing things to passe, men that know not what it is that we call"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2678,"Causing, (that is, almost all men) have no other rule to guesse by, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2679,"by observing, and remembring what they have seen to precede the like"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2680,"effect at some other time, or times before, without seeing between the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2681,"antecedent and subsequent Event, any dependance or connexion at all:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2682,"And therefore from the like things past, they expect the like things to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2683,"come; and hope for good or evill luck, superstitiously, from things that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2684,have no part at all in the causing of it: As the Athenians did for their
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2685,"war at Lepanto, demand another Phormio; the Pompeian faction for their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2686,"warre in Afrique, another Scipio; and others have done in divers other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2687,occasions since. In like manner they attribute their fortune to a
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2688,"stander by, to a lucky or unlucky place, to words spoken, especially"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2689,"if the name of God be amongst them; as Charming, and Conjuring (the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2690,"Leiturgy of Witches;) insomuch as to believe, they have power to turn a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2691,"stone into bread, bread into a man, or any thing, into any thing."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2692,But Honour Them As They Honour Men
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2693,"Thirdly, for the worship which naturally men exhibite to Powers"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2694,"invisible, it can be no other, but such expressions of their reverence,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2695,"as they would use towards men; Gifts, Petitions, Thanks, Submission"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2696,"of Body, Considerate Addresses, sober Behaviour, premeditated Words,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2697,"Swearing (that is, assuring one another of their promises,) by invoking"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2698,them. Beyond that reason suggesteth nothing; but leaves them either to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2699,"rest there; or for further ceremonies, to rely on those they believe to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2700,be wiser than themselves.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2701,And Attribute To Them All Extraordinary Events
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2702,"Lastly, concerning how these Invisible Powers declare to men the things"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2703,"which shall hereafter come to passe, especially concerning their good"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2704,"or evill fortune in generall, or good or ill successe in any particular"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2705,"undertaking, men are naturally at a stand; save that using to conjecture"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2706,"of the time to come, by the time past, they are very apt, not onely to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2707,"take casuall things, after one or two encounters, for Prognostiques"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2708,"of the like encounter ever after, but also to believe the like"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2709,"Prognostiques from other men, of whom they have once conceived a good"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2710,opinion.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2711,"Foure Things, Naturall Seeds Of Religion"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2712,"And in these foure things, Opinion of Ghosts, Ignorance of second"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2713,"causes, Devotion towards what men fear, and Taking of things Casuall for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2714,"Prognostiques, consisteth the Naturall seed of Religion; which by reason"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2715,"of the different Fancies, Judgements, and Passions of severall men, hath"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2716,"grown up into ceremonies so different, that those which are used by one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2717,"man, are for the most part ridiculous to another."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2718,Made Different By Culture
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2719,For these seeds have received culture from two sorts of men. One sort
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2720,"have been they, that have nourished, and ordered them, according to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2721,"their own invention. The other, have done it, by Gods commandement, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2722,"direction: but both sorts have done it, with a purpose to make those men"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2723,"that relyed on them, the more apt to Obedience, Lawes, Peace, Charity,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2724,"and civill Society. So that the Religion of the former sort, is a part"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2725,of humane Politiques; and teacheth part of the duty which Earthly Kings
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2726,require of their Subjects. And the Religion of the later sort is
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2727,Divine Politiques; and containeth Precepts to those that have yeelded
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2728,"themselves subjects in the Kingdome of God. Of the former sort, were all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2729,"the Founders of Common-wealths, and the Law-givers of the Gentiles: Of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2730,"the later sort, were Abraham, Moses, and our Blessed Saviour; by whom"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2731,have been derived unto us the Lawes of the Kingdome of God.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2732,The Absurd Opinion Of Gentilisme
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2733,"And for that part of Religion, which consisteth in opinions concerning"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2734,"the nature of Powers Invisible, there is almost nothing that has a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2735,"name, that has not been esteemed amongst the Gentiles, in one place or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2736,"another, a God, or Divell; or by their Poets feigned to be inanimated,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2737,"inhabited, or possessed by some Spirit or other."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2738,"The unformed matter of the World, was a God, by the name of Chaos."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2739,"The Heaven, the Ocean, the Planets, the Fire, the Earth, the Winds, were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2740,so many Gods.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2741,"Men, Women, a Bird, a Crocodile, a Calf, a Dogge, a Snake, an Onion,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2742,"a Leeke, Deified. Besides, that they filled almost all places, with"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2743,"spirits called Daemons; the plains, with Pan, and Panises, or Satyres;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2744,"the Woods, with Fawnes, and Nymphs; the Sea, with Tritons, and other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2745,"Nymphs; every River, and Fountayn, with a Ghost of his name, and with"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2746,"Nymphs; every house, with it Lares, or Familiars; every man, with his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2747,"Genius; Hell, with Ghosts, and spirituall Officers, as Charon, Cerberus,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2748,"and the Furies; and in the night time, all places with Larvae, Lemures,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2749,"Ghosts of men deceased, and a whole kingdome of Fayries, and Bugbears."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2750,"They have also ascribed Divinity, and built Temples to meer Accidents,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2751,"and Qualities; such as are Time, Night, Day, Peace, Concord, Love,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2752,"Contention, Vertue, Honour, Health, Rust, Fever, and the like; which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2753,"when they prayed for, or against, they prayed to, as if there were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2754,"Ghosts of those names hanging over their heads, and letting fall, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2755,"withholding that Good, or Evill, for, or against which they prayed. They"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2756,"invoked also their own Wit, by the name of Muses; their own Ignorance,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2757,"by the name of Fortune; their own Lust, by the name of Cupid; their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2758,"own Rage, by the name Furies; their own privy members by the name of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2759,"Priapus; and attributed their pollutions, to Incubi, and Succubae:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2760,"insomuch as there was nothing, which a Poet could introduce as a person"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2761,"in his Poem, which they did not make either a God, or a Divel."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2762,"The same authors of the Religion of the Gentiles, observing the second"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2763,"ground for Religion, which is mens Ignorance of causes; and thereby"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2764,"their aptnesse to attribute their fortune to causes, on which there"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2765,"was no dependence at all apparent, took occasion to obtrude on their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2766,"ignorance, in stead of second causes, a kind of second and ministeriall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2767,"Gods; ascribing the cause of Foecundity, to Venus; the cause of Arts, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2768,"Apollo; of Subtilty and Craft, to Mercury; of Tempests and stormes,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2769,"to Aeolus; and of other effects, to other Gods: insomuch as there was"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2770,"amongst the Heathen almost as great variety of Gods, as of businesse."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2771,"And to the Worship, which naturally men conceived fit to bee used"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2772,"towards their Gods, namely Oblations, Prayers, Thanks, and the rest"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2773,formerly named; the same Legislators of the Gentiles have added their
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2774,"Images, both in Picture, and Sculpture; that the more ignorant sort,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2775,"(that is to say, the most part, or generality of the people,) thinking"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2776,"the Gods for whose representation they were made, were really included,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2777,"and as it were housed within them, might so much the more stand in feare"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2833,"not be thought to proceed from their own device, but from the dictates"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2835,"higher nature than mere mortalls, that their Lawes might the more easily"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2836,be received: So Numa Pompilius pretended to receive the Ceremonies he

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2838,"and founder of the Kingdome of Peru, pretended himselfe and his wife to"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2841,"Secondly, they have had a care, to make it believed, that the same"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2842,"things were displeasing to the Gods, which were forbidden by the"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2844,"Festivalls, by which they were to believe, the anger of the Gods might"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2846,"Earthquakes, and each mans private Misery, came from the Anger of"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2848,"forgetting, or mistaking some point of the Ceremonies required. And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2849,"though amongst the antient Romans, men were not forbidden to deny, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2850,"which in the Poets is written of the paines, and pleasures after this"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2854,"And by these, and such other Institutions, they obtayned in order to"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2856,"people in their misfortunes, laying the fault on neglect, or errour in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2857,"their Ceremonies, or on their own disobedience to the lawes, were the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2858,lesse apt to mutiny against their Governors. And being entertained with
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2859,"the pomp, and pastime of Festivalls, and publike Gomes, made in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2860,"honour of the Gods, needed nothing else but bread, to keep them from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2861,"discontent, murmuring, and commotion against the State. And therefore"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2862,"the Romans, that had conquered the greatest part of the then known"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2863,"World, made no scruple of tollerating any Religion whatsoever in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2864,"City of Rome it selfe; unlesse it had somthing in it, that could not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2865,"consist with their Civill Government; nor do we read, that any Religion"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2866,"was there forbidden, but that of the Jewes; who (being the peculiar"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2867,Kingdome of God) thought it unlawfull to acknowledge subjection to any
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2868,mortall King or State whatsoever. And thus you see how the Religion of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2869,the Gentiles was a part of their Policy.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2870,"The True Religion, And The Lawes Of Gods Kingdome The Same But where God"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2872,"also made to himselfe a peculiar Kingdome; and gave Lawes, not only of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2873,behaviour towards himselfe; but also towards one another; and thereby
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2874,"in the Kingdome of God, the Policy, and lawes Civill, are a part of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2875,"Religion; and therefore the distinction of Temporall, and Spirituall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2876,"Domination, hath there no place. It is true, that God is King of all the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2877,"Earth: Yet may he be King of a peculiar, and chosen Nation. For there is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2878,"no more incongruity therein, than that he that hath the generall command"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2879,"of the whole Army, should have withall a peculiar Regiment, or Company"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2880,of his own. God is King of all the Earth by his Power: but of his
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2881,"chosen people, he is King by Covenant. But to speake more largly of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2882,"Kingdome of God, both by Nature, and Covenant, I have in the following"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2886,"the causes of the resolution of the same into its first seeds, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2887,"principles; which are only an opinion of a Deity, and Powers invisible,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2888,"and supernaturall; that can never be so abolished out of humane nature,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2889,"but that new Religions may againe be made to spring out of them, by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2890,"culture of such men, as for such purpose are in reputation."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2891,"For seeing all formed Religion, is founded at first, upon the faith"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2893,"be a wise man, and to labour to procure their happiness, but also to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2894,"be a holy man, to whom God himselfe vouchsafeth to declare his will"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2895,"supernaturally; It followeth necessarily, when they that have the"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2898,be unable to shew any probable token of divine Revelation; that the

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2904,of a beliefe of contradictories: For both parts of a contradiction
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2905,"cannot possibly be true: and therefore to enjoyne the beliefe of them,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2906,is an argument of ignorance; which detects the Author in that; and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2907,discredits him in all things else he shall propound as from revelation
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2908,supernaturall: which revelation a man may indeed have of many things

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2933,"the places, in which they be educated, have wrought into them. For as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2934,"in naturall things, men of judgement require naturall signes,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2935,"and arguments; so in supernaturall things, they require signes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2936,"supernaturall, (which are Miracles,) before they consent inwardly, and"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2938,"All which causes of the weakening of mens faith, do manifestly appear"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2939,"in the Examples following. First, we have the Example of the children"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2941,"Miracles, and by the happy conduct of them out of Egypt, was absent but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2942,"40 dayes, revolted from the worship of the true God, recommended to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2943,"them by him; and setting up (Exod.32 1,2) a Golden Calfe for their God,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2944,relapsed into the Idolatry of the Egyptians; from whom they had been
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2945,"so lately delivered. And again, after Moses, Aaron, Joshua, and that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2946,"generation which had seen the great works of God in Israel, (Judges"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2947,"2 11) were dead; another generation arose, and served Baal. So that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2948,"Miracles fayling, Faith also failed."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2949,"Again, when the sons of Samuel, (1 Sam.8.3) being constituted by their"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2952,manner than he was King of other people; and therefore cryed out to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2953,"Samuel, to choose them a King after the manner of the Nations. So that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2954,"Justice Fayling, Faith also fayled: Insomuch, as they deposed their God,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2955,from reigning over them.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2956,"And whereas in the planting of Christian Religion, the Oracles ceased"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2958,"wonderfully every day, and in every place, by the preaching of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2959,"Apostles, and Evangelists; a great part of that successe, may reasonably"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2960,"be attributed, to the contempt, into which the Priests of the Gentiles"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2961,"of that time, had brought themselves, by their uncleannesse, avarice,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2962,"and jugling between Princes. Also the Religion of the Church of Rome,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2963,"was partly, for the same cause abolished in England, and many other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2964,"parts of Christendome; insomuch, as the fayling of Vertue in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2965,"Pastors, maketh Faith faile in the People: and partly from bringing"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2966,"of the Philosophy, and doctrine of Aristotle into Religion, by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2967,"Schoole-men; from whence there arose so many contradictions, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,12,2968,"absurdities, as brought the Clergy into a reputation both of Ignorance,"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3001,"together, the difference between man, and man, is not so considerable,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3002,"as that one man can thereupon claim to himselfe any benefit, to which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3003,"another may not pretend, as well as he. For as to the strength of body,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3004,"the weakest has strength enough to kill the strongest, either by secret"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3005,"machination, or by confederacy with others, that are in the same danger"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3006,with himselfe.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3007,"And as to the faculties of the mind, (setting aside the arts grounded"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3008,"upon words, and especially that skill of proceeding upon generall, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3009,"infallible rules, called Science; which very few have, and but in few"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3010,"things; as being not a native faculty, born with us; nor attained,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3011,"(as Prudence,) while we look after somewhat els,) I find yet a greater"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3012,"equality amongst men, than that of strength. For Prudence, is but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3013,"Experience; which equall time, equally bestowes on all men, in those"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3014,things they equally apply themselves unto. That which may perhaps make
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3015,"such equality incredible, is but a vain conceipt of ones owne wisdome,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3016,"which almost all men think they have in a greater degree, than the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3017,"Vulgar; that is, than all men but themselves, and a few others, whom by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3018,"Fame, or for concurring with themselves, they approve. For such is the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3019,"nature of men, that howsoever they may acknowledge many others to be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3020,"more witty, or more eloquent, or more learned; Yet they will hardly"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3021,believe there be many so wise as themselves: For they see their own wit
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3022,"at hand, and other mens at a distance. But this proveth rather that men"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3023,"are in that point equall, than unequall. For there is not ordinarily a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3024,"greater signe of the equall distribution of any thing, than that every"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3025,man is contented with his share.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3026,From Equality Proceeds Diffidence
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3027,"From this equality of ability, ariseth equality of hope in the attaining"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3028,"of our Ends. And therefore if any two men desire the same thing, which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3029,"neverthelesse they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies; and in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3030,"way to their End, (which is principally their owne conservation, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3031,"sometimes their delectation only,) endeavour to destroy, or subdue one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3032,"an other. And from hence it comes to passe, that where an Invader hath"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3033,"no more to feare, than an other mans single power; if one plant, sow,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3034,"build, or possesse a convenient Seat, others may probably be expected to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3035,"come prepared with forces united, to dispossesse, and deprive him, not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3036,"only of the fruit of his labour, but also of his life, or liberty. And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3037,the Invader again is in the like danger of another.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3038,From Diffidence Warre
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3039,"And from this diffidence of one another, there is no way for any man to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3040,"secure himselfe, so reasonable, as Anticipation; that is, by force, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3041,"wiles, to master the persons of all men he can, so long, till he see no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3042,other power great enough to endanger him: And this is no more than his
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3043,"own conservation requireth, and is generally allowed. Also because there"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3044,"be some, that taking pleasure in contemplating their own power in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3045,"the acts of conquest, which they pursue farther than their security"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3046,"requires; if others, that otherwise would be glad to be at ease within"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3047,"modest bounds, should not by invasion increase their power, they would"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3048,"not be able, long time, by standing only on their defence, to subsist."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3049,"And by consequence, such augmentation of dominion over men, being"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3050,"necessary to a mans conservation, it ought to be allowed him."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3051,"Againe, men have no pleasure, (but on the contrary a great deale of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3052,"griefe) in keeping company, where there is no power able to over-awe"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3053,"them all. For every man looketh that his companion should value him, at"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3054,"the same rate he sets upon himselfe: And upon all signes of contempt,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3055,"or undervaluing, naturally endeavours, as far as he dares (which amongst"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3056,"them that have no common power, to keep them in quiet, is far enough"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3057,"to make them destroy each other,) to extort a greater value from his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3058,"contemners, by dommage; and from others, by the example."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3059,"So that in the nature of man, we find three principall causes of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3060,"quarrel. First, Competition; Secondly, Diffidence; Thirdly, Glory."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3061,"The first, maketh men invade for Gain; the second, for Safety; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3062,"the third, for Reputation. The first use Violence, to make themselves"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3063,"Masters of other mens persons, wives, children, and cattell; the second,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3064,"to defend them; the third, for trifles, as a word, a smile, a different"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3065,"opinion, and any other signe of undervalue, either direct in their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3066,"Persons, or by reflexion in their Kindred, their Friends, their Nation,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3067,"their Profession, or their Name."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3068,"Out Of Civil States,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3069,There Is Alwayes Warre Of Every One Against Every One Hereby it is
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3070,"manifest, that during the time men live without a common Power to keep"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3071,"them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called Warre;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3072,"and such a warre, as is of every man, against every man. For WARRE,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3073,"consisteth not in Battell onely, or the act of fighting; but in a tract"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3074,"of time, wherein the Will to contend by Battell is sufficiently known:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3075,"and therefore the notion of Time, is to be considered in the nature of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3076,Warre; as it is in the nature of Weather. For as the nature of Foule
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3077,"weather, lyeth not in a showre or two of rain; but in an inclination"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3078,"thereto of many dayes together: So the nature of War, consisteth not in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3079,"actuall fighting; but in the known disposition thereto, during all the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3080,time there is no assurance to the contrary. All other time is PEACE.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3081,The Incommodites Of Such A War
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3082,"Whatsoever therefore is consequent to a time of Warre, where every man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3083,"is Enemy to every man; the same is consequent to the time, wherein men"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3084,"live without other security, than what their own strength, and their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3085,"own invention shall furnish them withall. In such condition, there is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3086,no place for Industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain; and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3087,"consequently no Culture of the Earth; no Navigation, nor use of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3088,commodities that may be imported by Sea; no commodious Building; no
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3089,"Instruments of moving, and removing such things as require much force;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3090,no Knowledge of the face of the Earth; no account of Time; no Arts; no
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3091,"Letters; no Society; and which is worst of all, continuall feare, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3092,"danger of violent death; And the life of man, solitary, poore, nasty,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3093,"brutish, and short."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3094,"It may seem strange to some man, that has not well weighed these things;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3095,"that Nature should thus dissociate, and render men apt to invade,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3096,"and destroy one another: and he may therefore, not trusting to this"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3097,"Inference, made from the Passions, desire perhaps to have the same"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3098,"confirmed by Experience. Let him therefore consider with himselfe, when"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3099,"taking a journey, he armes himselfe, and seeks to go well accompanied;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3100,"when going to sleep, he locks his dores; when even in his house he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3101,"locks his chests; and this when he knows there bee Lawes, and publike"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3102,"Officers, armed, to revenge all injuries shall bee done him; what"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3103,"opinion he has of his fellow subjects, when he rides armed; of his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3104,"fellow Citizens, when he locks his dores; and of his children, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3105,"servants, when he locks his chests. Does he not there as much accuse"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3106,"mankind by his actions, as I do by my words? But neither of us accuse"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3107,"mans nature in it. The Desires, and other Passions of man, are in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3108,"themselves no Sin. No more are the Actions, that proceed from those"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3109,"Passions, till they know a Law that forbids them; which till Lawes be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3110,"made they cannot know: nor can any Law be made, till they have agreed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3111,upon the Person that shall make it.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3112,"It may peradventure be thought, there was never such a time, nor"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3113,"condition of warre as this; and I believe it was never generally so,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3114,"over all the world: but there are many places, where they live so now."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3115,"For the savage people in many places of America, except the government"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3116,"of small Families, the concord whereof dependeth on naturall lust, have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3117,"no government at all; and live at this day in that brutish manner, as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3118,"I said before. Howsoever, it may be perceived what manner of life there"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3119,"would be, where there were no common Power to feare; by the manner of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3120,"life, which men that have formerly lived under a peacefull government,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3121,"use to degenerate into, in a civill Warre."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3122,"But though there had never been any time, wherein particular men were in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3123,"a condition of warre one against another; yet in all times, Kings, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3124,"persons of Soveraigne authority, because of their Independency, are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3125,"in continuall jealousies, and in the state and posture of Gladiators;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3126,"having their weapons pointing, and their eyes fixed on one another;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3127,"that is, their Forts, Garrisons, and Guns upon the Frontiers of their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3128,Kingdomes; and continuall Spyes upon their neighbours; which is a
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3129,"posture of War. But because they uphold thereby, the Industry of their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3130,"Subjects; there does not follow from it, that misery, which accompanies"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3131,the Liberty of particular men.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3132,"In Such A Warre, Nothing Is Unjust"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3133,"To this warre of every man against every man, this also is consequent;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3134,"that nothing can be Unjust. The notions of Right and Wrong, Justice and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3135,"Injustice have there no place. Where there is no common Power, there is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3136,"no Law: where no Law, no Injustice. Force, and Fraud, are in warre the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3137,"two Cardinall vertues. Justice, and Injustice are none of the Faculties"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3138,"neither of the Body, nor Mind. If they were, they might be in a man that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3139,"were alone in the world, as well as his Senses, and Passions. They"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3140,"are Qualities, that relate to men in Society, not in Solitude. It is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3141,"consequent also to the same condition, that there be no Propriety, no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3142,"Dominion, no Mine and Thine distinct; but onely that to be every mans"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3143,"that he can get; and for so long, as he can keep it. And thus much"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3144,"for the ill condition, which man by meer Nature is actually placed in;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3145,"though with a possibility to come out of it, consisting partly in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3146,"Passions, partly in his Reason."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3147,The Passions That Incline Men To Peace
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3148,"The Passions that encline men to Peace, are Feare of Death; Desire of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3149,such things as are necessary to commodious living; and a Hope by their
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3150,Industry to obtain them. And Reason suggesteth convenient Articles of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3151,"Peace, upon which men may be drawn to agreement. These Articles, are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3152,"they, which otherwise are called the Lawes of Nature: whereof I shall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,13,3153,"speak more particularly, in the two following Chapters."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3154,"CHAPTER XIV. OF THE FIRST AND SECOND NATURALL LAWES, AND OF CONTRACTS"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3155,Right Of Nature What
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3156,"The RIGHT OF NATURE, which Writers commonly call Jus Naturale, is the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3157,"Liberty each man hath, to use his own power, as he will himselfe, for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3158,"the preservation of his own Nature; that is to say, of his own Life;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3159,"and consequently, of doing any thing, which in his own Judgement, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3160,"Reason, hee shall conceive to be the aptest means thereunto."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3161,Liberty What
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3162,"By LIBERTY, is understood, according to the proper signification of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3163,"word, the absence of externall Impediments: which Impediments, may oft"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3164,take away part of a mans power to do what hee would; but cannot hinder
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3165,"him from using the power left him, according as his judgement, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3166,reason shall dictate to him.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3167,A Law Of Nature What
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3168,"A LAW OF NATURE, (Lex Naturalis,) is a Precept, or generall Rule,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3169,"found out by Reason, by which a man is forbidden to do, that, which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3170,"is destructive of his life, or taketh away the means of preserving the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3171,"same; and to omit, that, by which he thinketh it may be best preserved."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3172,"For though they that speak of this subject, use to confound Jus, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3173,"Lex, Right and Law; yet they ought to be distinguished; because RIGHT,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3174,"consisteth in liberty to do, or to forbeare; Whereas LAW, determineth,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3175,"and bindeth to one of them: so that Law, and Right, differ as much,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3176,"as Obligation, and Liberty; which in one and the same matter are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3177,inconsistent.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3178,Naturally Every Man Has Right To Everything
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3179,"And because the condition of Man, (as hath been declared in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3180,precedent Chapter) is a condition of Warre of every one against every
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3181,one; in which case every one is governed by his own Reason; and there
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3182,"is nothing he can make use of, that may not be a help unto him, in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3183,"preserving his life against his enemyes; It followeth, that in such a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3184,"condition, every man has a Right to every thing; even to one anothers"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3185,"body. And therefore, as long as this naturall Right of every man to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3186,"every thing endureth, there can be no security to any man, (how strong"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3187,"or wise soever he be,) of living out the time, which Nature ordinarily"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3188,alloweth men to live.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3189,The Fundamental Law Of Nature
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3190,"And consequently it is a precept, or generall rule of Reason, ""That"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3191,"every man, ought to endeavour Peace, as farre as he has hope of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3192,"obtaining it; and when he cannot obtain it, that he may seek, and use,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3193,"all helps, and advantages of Warre."" The first branch, of which Rule,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3194,"containeth the first, and Fundamentall Law of Nature; which is, ""To seek"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3195,"Peace, and follow it."" The Second, the summe of the Right of Nature;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3196,"which is, ""By all means we can, to defend our selves."""
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3197,The Second Law Of Nature
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3198,"From this Fundamentall Law of Nature, by which men are commanded to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3199,"endeavour Peace, is derived this second Law; ""That a man be willing,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3200,"when others are so too, as farre-forth, as for Peace, and defence of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3201,"himselfe he shall think it necessary, to lay down this right to all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3202,"things; and be contented with so much liberty against other men, as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3203,"he would allow other men against himselfe."" For as long as every man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3204,"holdeth this Right, of doing any thing he liketh; so long are all men in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3205,"the condition of Warre. But if other men will not lay down their Right,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3206,"as well as he; then there is no Reason for any one, to devest himselfe"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3207,"of his: For that were to expose himselfe to Prey, (which no man is bound"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3208,to) rather than to dispose himselfe to Peace. This is that Law of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3209,"Gospell; ""Whatsoever you require that others should do to you, that do"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3210,"ye to them."" And that Law of all men, ""Quod tibi feiri non vis, alteri"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3211,"ne feceris."""
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3212,What it is to lay down a Right
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3213,"To Lay Downe a mans Right to any thing, is to Devest himselfe of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3214,"Liberty, of hindring another of the benefit of his own Right to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3215,"same. For he that renounceth, or passeth away his Right, giveth not to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3216,any other man a Right which he had not before; because there is nothing
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3217,to which every man had not Right by Nature: but onely standeth out of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3218,"his way, that he may enjoy his own originall Right, without hindrance"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3219,from him; not without hindrance from another. So that the effect which
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3220,"redoundeth to one man, by another mans defect of Right, is but so much"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3223,"Right is layd aside, either by simply Renouncing it; or by Transferring"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3224,it to another. By Simply RENOUNCING; when he cares not to whom the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3225,benefit thereof redoundeth. By TRANSFERRING; when he intendeth the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3226,"benefit thereof to some certain person, or persons. And when a man hath"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3227,"in either manner abandoned, or granted away his Right; then is he said"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3228,"to be OBLIGED, or BOUND, not to hinder those, to whom such Right is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3229,"granted, or abandoned, from the benefit of it: and that he Ought, and it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3230,"his DUTY, not to make voyd that voluntary act of his own: and that such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3231,"hindrance is INJUSTICE, and INJURY, as being Sine Jure; the Right being"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3232,"before renounced, or transferred. So that Injury, or Injustice, in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3233,"the controversies of the world, is somewhat like to that, which in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3234,disputations of Scholers is called Absurdity. For as it is there called
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3235,"an Absurdity, to contradict what one maintained in the Beginning: so in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3236,"the world, it is called Injustice, and Injury, voluntarily to undo that,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3237,which from the beginning he had voluntarily done. The way by which a man
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3238,"either simply Renounceth, or Transferreth his Right, is a Declaration,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3239,"or Signification, by some voluntary and sufficient signe, or signes,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3240,"that he doth so Renounce, or Transferre; or hath so Renounced, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3241,"Transferred the same, to him that accepteth it. And these Signes are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3242,"either Words onely, or Actions onely; or (as it happeneth most often)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3243,"both Words and Actions. And the same are the BONDS, by which men are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3244,"bound, and obliged: Bonds, that have their strength, not from their own"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3245,"Nature, (for nothing is more easily broken then a mans word,) but from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3246,Feare of some evill consequence upon the rupture.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3247,Not All Rights Are Alienable
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3248,"Whensoever a man Transferreth his Right, or Renounceth it; it is either"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3249,in consideration of some Right reciprocally transferred to himselfe; or
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3250,for some other good he hopeth for thereby. For it is a voluntary act:
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3251,"and of the voluntary acts of every man, the object is some Good To"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3252,"Himselfe. And therefore there be some Rights, which no man can be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3253,"understood by any words, or other signes, to have abandoned, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3254,"transferred. As first a man cannot lay down the right of resisting them,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3255,"that assault him by force, to take away his life; because he cannot be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3256,"understood to ayme thereby, at any Good to himselfe. The same may be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3257,"sayd of Wounds, and Chayns, and Imprisonment; both because there is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3258,no benefit consequent to such patience; as there is to the patience of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3259,"suffering another to be wounded, or imprisoned: as also because a man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3260,"cannot tell, when he seeth men proceed against him by violence, whether"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3261,"they intend his death or not. And lastly the motive, and end for which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3262,"this renouncing, and transferring or Right is introduced, is nothing"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3263,"else but the security of a mans person, in his life, and in the means of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3264,"so preserving life, as not to be weary of it. And therefore if a man by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3265,"words, or other signes, seem to despoyle himselfe of the End, for which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3266,those signes were intended; he is not to be understood as if he meant
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3267,"it, or that it was his will; but that he was ignorant of how such words"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3268,and actions were to be interpreted.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3269,Contract What
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3270,"The mutuall transferring of Right, is that which men call CONTRACT."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3271,"There is difference, between transferring of Right to the Thing; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3272,"transferring, or tradition, that is, delivery of the Thing it selfe. For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3273,the Thing may be delivered together with the Translation of the Right;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3274,"as in buying and selling with ready mony; or exchange of goods, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3275,lands: and it may be delivered some time after.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3276,Covenant What
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3277,"Again, one of the Contractors, may deliver the Thing contracted for on"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3278,"his part, and leave the other to perform his part at some determinate"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3279,"time after, and in the mean time be trusted; and then the Contract on"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3280,"his part, is called PACT, or COVENANT: Or both parts may contract now,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3281,"to performe hereafter: in which cases, he that is to performe in time"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3282,"to come, being trusted, his performance is called Keeping Of Promise, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3283,Faith; and the fayling of performance (if it be voluntary) Violation Of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3284,Faith.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3285,Free-gift
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3286,"When the transferring of Right, is not mutuall; but one of the parties"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3287,"transferreth, in hope to gain thereby friendship, or service from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3288,"another, or from his friends; or in hope to gain the reputation of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3289,"Charity, or Magnanimity; or to deliver his mind from the pain of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3290,"compassion; or in hope of reward in heaven; This is not Contract, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3291,"GIFT, FREEGIFT, GRACE: which words signifie one and the same thing."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3292,Signes Of Contract Expresse
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3293,"Signes of Contract, are either Expresse, or By Inference. Expresse, are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3294,words spoken with understanding of what they signifie; And such words
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3295,"are either of the time Present, or Past; as, I Give, I Grant, I Have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3296,"Given, I Have Granted, I Will That This Be Yours: Or of the future;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3297,"as, I Will Give, I Will Grant; which words of the future, are called"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3298,Promise.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3299,Signes Of Contract By Inference
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3300,"Signes by Inference, are sometimes the consequence of Words; sometimes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3301,the consequence of Silence; sometimes the consequence of Actions;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3302,sometimes the consequence of Forbearing an Action: and generally a signe
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3303,"by Inference, of any Contract, is whatsoever sufficiently argues the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3304,will of the Contractor.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3305,Free Gift Passeth By Words Of The Present Or Past
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3306,"Words alone, if they be of the time to come, and contain a bare promise,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3307,are an insufficient signe of a Free-gift and therefore not obligatory.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3308,"For if they be of the time to Come, as, To Morrow I Will Give, they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3309,"are a signe I have not given yet, and consequently that my right is not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3310,"transferred, but remaineth till I transferre it by some other Act. But"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3311,"if the words be of the time Present, or Past, as, ""I have given, or do"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3312,"give to be delivered to morrow,"" then is my to morrows Right given away"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3313,"to day; and that by the vertue of the words, though there were no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3314,other argument of my will. And there is a great difference in the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3315,"signification of these words, Volos Hoc Tuum Esse Cras, and Cros Dabo;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3316,"that is between ""I will that this be thine to morrow,"" and, ""I will"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3317,"give it to thee to morrow:"" For the word I Will, in the former manner"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3318,"of speech, signifies an act of the will Present; but in the later, it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3319,signifies a promise of an act of the will to Come: and therefore the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3320,"former words, being of the Present, transferre a future right; the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3321,"later, that be of the Future, transferre nothing. But if there be other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3322,"signes of the Will to transferre a Right, besides Words; then, though"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3323,"the gift be Free, yet may the Right be understood to passe by words of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3324,the future: as if a man propound a Prize to him that comes first to the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3325,"end of a race, The gift is Free; and though the words be of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3326,"Future, yet the Right passeth: for if he would not have his words so be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3327,"understood, he should not have let them runne."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3328,"Signes Of Contract Are Words Both Of The Past, Present, and Future In"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3329,"Contracts, the right passeth, not onely where the words are of the time"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3330,"Present, or Past; but also where they are of the Future; because all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3331,"Contract is mutuall translation, or change of Right; and therefore he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3332,"that promiseth onely, because he hath already received the benefit for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3333,"which he promiseth, is to be understood as if he intended the Right"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3334,should passe: for unlesse he had been content to have his words so
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3335,"understood, the other would not have performed his part first. And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3336,"for that cause, in buying, and selling, and other acts of Contract, A"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3337,Promise is equivalent to a Covenant; and therefore obligatory.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3338,Merit What
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3339,"He that performeth first in the case of a Contract, is said to MERIT"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3340,that which he is to receive by the performance of the other; and he hath
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3341,"it as Due. Also when a Prize is propounded to many, which is to be given"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3342,"to him onely that winneth; or mony is thrown amongst many, to be enjoyed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3343,"by them that catch it; though this be a Free Gift; yet so to Win, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3344,"so to Catch, is to Merit, and to have it as DUE. For the Right is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3345,"transferred in the Propounding of the Prize, and in throwing down the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3346,"mony; though it be not determined to whom, but by the Event of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3347,"contention. But there is between these two sorts of Merit, this"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3348,"difference, that In Contract, I Merit by vertue of my own power, and the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3349,"Contractors need; but in this case of Free Gift, I am enabled to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3350,"Merit onely by the benignity of the Giver; In Contract, I merit at The"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3351,Contractors hand that hee should depart with his right; In this case of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3352,"gift, I Merit not that the giver should part with his right; but that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3353,"when he has parted with it, it should be mine, rather than anothers."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3354,"And this I think to be the meaning of that distinction of the Schooles,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3355,"between Meritum Congrui, and Meritum Condigni. For God Almighty, having"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3356,"promised Paradise to those men (hoodwinkt with carnall desires,) that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3357,"can walk through this world according to the Precepts, and Limits"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3358,"prescribed by him; they say, he that shall so walk, shall Merit Paradise"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3359,"Ex Congruo. But because no man can demand a right to it, by his own"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3360,"Righteousnesse, or any other power in himselfe, but by the Free Grace of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3361,"God onely; they say, no man can Merit Paradise Ex Condigno. This I say,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3362,I think is the meaning of that distinction; but because Disputers do not
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3363,"agree upon the signification of their own termes of Art, longer than it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3364,serves their turn; I will not affirme any thing of their meaning:
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3365,"onely this I say; when a gift is given indefinitely, as a prize to be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3366,"contended for, he that winneth Meriteth, and may claime the Prize as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3367,Due.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3368,"Covenants Of Mutuall Trust, When Invalid"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3369,"If a Covenant be made, wherein neither of the parties performe"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3370,"presently, but trust one another; in the condition of meer Nature,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3371,"(which is a condition of Warre of every man against every man,) upon"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3372,"any reasonable suspition, it is Voyd; But if there be a common Power set"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3373,"over them bothe, with right and force sufficient to compell performance;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3374,"it is not Voyd. For he that performeth first, has no assurance the other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3375,will performe after; because the bonds of words are too weak to bridle
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3376,"mens ambition, avarice, anger, and other Passions, without the feare of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3377,"some coerceive Power; which in the condition of meer Nature, where all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3378,"men are equall, and judges of the justnesse of their own fears cannot"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3379,"possibly be supposed. And therefore he which performeth first, does"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3380,but betray himselfe to his enemy; contrary to the Right (he can never
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3381,"abandon) of defending his life, and means of living."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3382,"But in a civill estate, where there is a Power set up to constrain"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3383,"those that would otherwise violate their faith, that feare is no more"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3384,"reasonable; and for that cause, he which by the Covenant is to perform"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3385,"first, is obliged so to do."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3386,"The cause of Feare, which maketh such a Covenant invalid, must be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3387,"alwayes something arising after the Covenant made; as some new fact,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3388,or other signe of the Will not to performe; else it cannot make the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3389,"Covenant Voyd. For that which could not hinder a man from promising,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3390,ought not to be admitted as a hindrance of performing.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3391,"Right To The End, Containeth Right To The Means"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3392,"He that transferreth any Right, transferreth the Means of enjoying it,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3393,"as farre as lyeth in his power. As he that selleth Land, is understood"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3394,"to transferre the Herbage, and whatsoever growes upon it; Nor can he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3395,that sells a Mill turn away the Stream that drives it. And they that
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3396,"give to a man The Right of government in Soveraignty, are understood"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3397,to give him the right of levying mony to maintain Souldiers; and of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3398,appointing Magistrates for the administration of Justice.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3399,No Covenant With Beasts
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3400,"To make Covenant with bruit Beasts, is impossible; because not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3401,"understanding our speech, they understand not, nor accept of any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3402,translation of Right; nor can translate any Right to another; and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3403,"without mutuall acceptation, there is no Covenant."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3404,Nor With God Without Speciall Revelation
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3405,"To make Covenant with God, is impossible, but by Mediation of such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3406,"as God speaketh to, either by Revelation supernaturall, or by his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3407,"Lieutenants that govern under him, and in his Name; For otherwise we"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3408,"know not whether our Covenants be accepted, or not. And therefore they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3409,"that Vow any thing contrary to any law of Nature, Vow in vain; as being"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3410,a thing unjust to pay such Vow. And if it be a thing commanded by the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3411,"Law of Nature, it is not the Vow, but the Law that binds them."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3412,"No Covenant, But Of Possible And Future"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3413,"The matter, or subject of a Covenant, is alwayes something that falleth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3414,"under deliberation; (For to Covenant, is an act of the Will; that is to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3415,"say an act, and the last act, of deliberation;) and is therefore alwayes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3416,understood to be something to come; and which is judged Possible for him
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3417,"that Covenanteth, to performe."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3418,"And therefore, to promise that which is known to be Impossible, is no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3419,"Covenant. But if that prove impossible afterwards, which before was"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3420,"thought possible, the Covenant is valid, and bindeth, (though not to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3421,"thing it selfe,) yet to the value; or, if that also be impossible, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3422,the unfeigned endeavour of performing as much as is possible; for to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3423,more no man can be obliged.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3424,Covenants How Made Voyd
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3425,Men are freed of their Covenants two wayes; by Performing; or by being
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3426,"Forgiven. For Performance, is the naturall end of obligation; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3427,"Forgivenesse, the restitution of liberty; as being a retransferring of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3428,"that Right, in which the obligation consisted."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3429,Covenants Extorted By Feare Are Valide
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3430,"Covenants entred into by fear, in the condition of meer Nature, are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3431,"obligatory. For example, if I Covenant to pay a ransome, or service for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3432,"my life, to an enemy; I am bound by it. For it is a Contract, wherein"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3433,"one receiveth the benefit of life; the other is to receive mony,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3434,"or service for it; and consequently, where no other Law (as in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3435,"condition, of meer Nature) forbiddeth the performance, the Covenant"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3436,"is valid. Therefore Prisoners of warre, if trusted with the payment of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3437,"their Ransome, are obliged to pay it; And if a weaker Prince, make a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3438,"disadvantageous peace with a stronger, for feare; he is bound to keep"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3439,"it; unlesse (as hath been sayd before) there ariseth some new, and just"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3440,"cause of feare, to renew the war. And even in Common-wealths, if I be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3441,"forced to redeem my selfe from a Theefe by promising him mony, I am"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3442,"bound to pay it, till the Civill Law discharge me. For whatsoever I may"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3443,"lawfully do without Obligation, the same I may lawfully Covenant to do"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3444,"through feare: and what I lawfully Covenant, I cannot lawfully break."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3445,"The Former Covenant To One, Makes Voyd The Later To Another"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3446,"A former Covenant, makes voyd a later. For a man that hath passed away"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3447,"his Right to one man to day, hath it not to passe to morrow to another:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3448,"and therefore the later promise passeth no Right, but is null."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3449,"A Mans Covenant Not To Defend Himselfe, Is Voyd"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3450,"A Covenant not to defend my selfe from force, by force, is alwayes voyd."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3451,"For (as I have shewed before) no man can transferre, or lay down his"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3454,"and therefore the promise of not resisting force, in no Covenant"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3455,transferreth any right; nor is obliging. For though a man may Covenant
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3456,"thus, ""Unlesse I do so, or so, kill me;"" he cannot Covenant thus ""Unless"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3457,"I do so, or so, I will not resist you, when you come to kill me."" For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3458,"man by nature chooseth the lesser evill, which is danger of death in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3459,"resisting; rather than the greater, which is certain and present death"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3460,"in not resisting. And this is granted to be true by all men, in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3461,"that they lead Criminals to Execution, and Prison, with armed men,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3462,"notwithstanding that such Criminals have consented to the Law, by which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3463,they are condemned.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3464,No Man Obliged To Accuse Himselfe
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3465,"A Covenant to accuse ones Selfe, without assurance of pardon, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3466,"likewise invalide. For in the condition of Nature, where every man is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3467,"Judge, there is no place for Accusation: and in the Civill State, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3468,"Accusation is followed with Punishment; which being Force, a man is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3469,"not obliged not to resist. The same is also true, of the Accusation of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3470,"those, by whose Condemnation a man falls into misery; as of a Father,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3471,"Wife, or Benefactor. For the Testimony of such an Accuser, if it be not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3472,"willingly given, is praesumed to be corrupted by Nature; and therefore"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3473,"not to be received: and where a mans Testimony is not to be credited,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3474,"his not bound to give it. Also Accusations upon Torture, are not to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3475,be reputed as Testimonies. For Torture is to be used but as means of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3476,"conjecture, and light, in the further examination, and search of truth;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3477,"and what is in that case confessed, tendeth to the ease of him that is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3478,Tortured; not to the informing of the Torturers: and therefore ought
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3479,not to have the credit of a sufficient Testimony: for whether he deliver
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3480,"himselfe by true, or false Accusation, he does it by the Right of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3481,preserving his own life.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3482,The End Of An Oath; The Forme Of As Oath
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3483,"The force of Words, being (as I have formerly noted) too weak to hold"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3484,"men to the performance of their Covenants; there are in mans nature, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3485,two imaginable helps to strengthen it. And those are either a Feare
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3486,"of the consequence of breaking their word; or a Glory, or Pride in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3487,appearing not to need to breake it. This later is a Generosity too
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3488,"rarely found to be presumed on, especially in the pursuers of Wealth,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3489,"Command, or sensuall Pleasure; which are the greatest part of Mankind."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3490,"The Passion to be reckoned upon, is Fear; whereof there be two very"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3491,"generall Objects: one, the Power of Spirits Invisible; the other, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3492,"Power of those men they shall therein Offend. Of these two, though the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3493,"former be the greater Power, yet the feare of the later is commonly"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3494,"the greater Feare. The Feare of the former is in every man, his own"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3495,Religion: which hath place in the nature of man before Civill Society.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3496,"The later hath not so; at least not place enough, to keep men to their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3497,"promises; because in the condition of meer Nature, the inequality of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3498,"Power is not discerned, but by the event of Battell. So that before the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3499,"time of Civill Society, or in the interruption thereof by Warre, there"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3500,"is nothing can strengthen a Covenant of Peace agreed on, against the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3501,"temptations of Avarice, Ambition, Lust, or other strong desire, but the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3502,"feare of that Invisible Power, which they every one Worship as God; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3503,Feare as a Revenger of their perfidy. All therefore that can be done
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3504,"between two men not subject to Civill Power, is to put one another"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3505,"to swear by the God he feareth: Which Swearing or OATH, is a Forme Of"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3510,"and thus, so help me God."" And this, with the Rites and Ceremonies,"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3516,Swearing by any thing which the Swearer thinks not God. For though men
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3517,"have sometimes used to swear by their Kings, for feare, or flattery; yet"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3518,"they would have it thereby understood, they attributed to them Divine"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3519,"honour. And that Swearing unnecessarily by God, is but prophaning of his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3520,"name: and Swearing by other things, as men do in common discourse, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,14,3521,"not Swearing, but an impious Custome, gotten by too much vehemence of"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3528,CHAPTER XV. OF OTHER LAWES OF NATURE
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3529,"The Third Law Of Nature, Justice"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3530,"From that law of Nature, by which we are obliged to transferre to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3531,"another, such Rights, as being retained, hinder the peace of Mankind,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3532,"there followeth a Third; which is this, That Men Performe Their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3533,"Covenants Made: without which, Covenants are in vain, and but Empty"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3534,"words; and the Right of all men to all things remaining, wee are still"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3535,in the condition of Warre.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3536,Justice And Injustice What
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3537,"And in this law of Nature, consisteth the Fountain and Originall of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3538,"JUSTICE. For where no Covenant hath preceded, there hath no Right been"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3539,"transferred, and every man has right to every thing; and consequently,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3540,"no action can be Unjust. But when a Covenant is made, then to break it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3541,"is Unjust: And the definition of INJUSTICE, is no other than The Not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3542,"Performance Of Covenant. And whatsoever is not Unjust, is Just."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3543,Justice And Propriety Begin With The Constitution of Common-wealth
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3544,"But because Covenants of mutuall trust, where there is a feare of not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3545,"performance on either part, (as hath been said in the former Chapter,)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3546,are invalid; though the Originall of Justice be the making of Covenants;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3547,"yet Injustice actually there can be none, till the cause of such feare"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3548,"be taken away; which while men are in the naturall condition of Warre,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3549,"cannot be done. Therefore before the names of Just, and Unjust can have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3550,"place, there must be some coercive Power, to compell men equally to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3551,"the performance of their Covenants, by the terrour of some punishment,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3552,greater than the benefit they expect by the breach of their Covenant;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3553,"and to make good that Propriety, which by mutuall Contract men acquire,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3554,in recompence of the universall Right they abandon: and such power there
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3555,is none before the erection of a Common-wealth. And this is also to be
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3556,gathered out of the ordinary definition of Justice in the Schooles: For
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3557,"they say, that ""Justice is the constant Will of giving to every man his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3558,"own."" And therefore where there is no Own, that is, no Propriety, there"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3559,"is no Injustice; and where there is no coerceive Power erected, that is,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3560,"where there is no Common-wealth, there is no Propriety; all men having"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3561,"Right to all things: Therefore where there is no Common-wealth, there"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3562,"nothing is Unjust. So that the nature of Justice, consisteth in keeping"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3563,of valid Covenants: but the Validity of Covenants begins not but with
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3564,"the Constitution of a Civill Power, sufficient to compell men to keep"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3565,them: And then it is also that Propriety begins.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3566,Justice Not Contrary To Reason
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3567,"The Foole hath sayd in his heart, there is no such thing as Justice;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3568,"and sometimes also with his tongue; seriously alleaging, that every mans"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3569,"conservation, and contentment, being committed to his own care, there"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3570,"could be no reason, why every man might not do what he thought conduced"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3571,"thereunto; and therefore also to make, or not make; keep, or not keep"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3572,"Covenants, was not against Reason, when it conduced to ones benefit."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3573,"He does not therein deny, that there be Covenants; and that they are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3574,"sometimes broken, sometimes kept; and that such breach of them may"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3575,"be called Injustice, and the observance of them Justice: but he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3576,"questioneth, whether Injustice, taking away the feare of God, (for the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3577,"same Foole hath said in his heart there is no God,) may not sometimes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3578,"stand with that Reason, which dictateth to every man his own good; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3579,"particularly then, when it conduceth to such a benefit, as shall put a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3580,"man in a condition, to neglect not onely the dispraise, and revilings,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3581,but also the power of other men. The Kingdome of God is gotten by
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3582,violence; but what if it could be gotten by unjust violence? were it
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3583,"against Reason so to get it, when it is impossible to receive hurt by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3584,"it? and if it be not against Reason, it is not against Justice; or else"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3585,"Justice is not to be approved for good. From such reasoning as this,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3586,Succesfull wickednesse hath obtained the Name of Vertue; and some that
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3587,in all other things have disallowed the violation of Faith; yet have
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3588,"allowed it, when it is for the getting of a Kingdome. And the Heathen"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3589,"that believed, that Saturn was deposed by his son Jupiter, believed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3590,neverthelesse the same Jupiter to be the avenger of Injustice: Somewhat
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3591,like to a piece of Law in Cokes Commentaries on Litleton; where he
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3592,"sayes, If the right Heire of the Crown be attainted of Treason; yet the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3593,"Crown shall descend to him, and Eo Instante the Atteynder be voyd; From"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3594,which instances a man will be very prone to inferre; that when the Heire
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3595,"apparent of a Kingdome, shall kill him that is in possession, though his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3596,"father; you may call it Injustice, or by what other name you will; yet"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3597,"it can never be against Reason, seeing all the voluntary actions of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3598,men tend to the benefit of themselves; and those actions are most
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3599,"Reasonable, that conduce most to their ends. This specious reasoning is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3600,nevertheless false.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3601,"For the question is not of promises mutuall, where there is no security"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3602,of performance on either side; as when there is no Civill Power erected
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3603,over the parties promising; for such promises are no Covenants: But
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3604,either where one of the parties has performed already; or where there
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3605,is a Power to make him performe; there is the question whether it be
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3606,"against reason, that is, against the benefit of the other to performe,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3607,or not. And I say it is not against reason. For the manifestation
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3608,"whereof, we are to consider; First, that when a man doth a thing, which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3609,"notwithstanding any thing can be foreseen, and reckoned on, tendeth to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3610,"his own destruction, howsoever some accident which he could not expect,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3611,arriving may turne it to his benefit; yet such events do not make it
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3612,"reasonably or wisely done. Secondly, that in a condition of Warre,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3613,"wherein every man to every man, for want of a common Power to keep them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3614,"all in awe, is an Enemy, there is no man can hope by his own strength,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3615,"or wit, to defend himselfe from destruction, without the help"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3616,of Confederates; where every one expects the same defence by the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3617,"Confederation, that any one else does: and therefore he which declares"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3618,"he thinks it reason to deceive those that help him, can in reason expect"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3619,"no other means of safety, than what can be had from his own single"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3620,"Power. He therefore that breaketh his Covenant, and consequently"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3621,"declareth that he thinks he may with reason do so, cannot be received"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3622,"into any Society, that unite themselves for Peace and defence, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3623,"by the errour of them that receive him; nor when he is received, be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3624,"retayned in it, without seeing the danger of their errour; which errours"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3625,a man cannot reasonably reckon upon as the means of his security; and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3626,"therefore if he be left, or cast out of Society, he perisheth; and if he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3627,"live in Society, it is by the errours of other men, which he could not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3628,"foresee, nor reckon upon; and consequently against the reason of his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3629,"preservation; and so, as all men that contribute not to his destruction,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3630,forbear him onely out of ignorance of what is good for themselves.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3631,As for the Instance of gaining the secure and perpetuall felicity of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3632,"Heaven, by any way; it is frivolous: there being but one way imaginable;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3633,"and that is not breaking, but keeping of Covenant."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3634,And for the other Instance of attaining Soveraignty by Rebellion; it is
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3635,"manifest, that though the event follow, yet because it cannot reasonably"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3636,"be expected, but rather the contrary; and because by gaining it so,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3637,"others are taught to gain the same in like manner, the attempt thereof"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3638,"is against reason. Justice therefore, that is to say, Keeping of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3639,"Covenant, is a Rule of Reason, by which we are forbidden to do any thing"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3640,destructive to our life; and consequently a Law of Nature.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3641,"There be some that proceed further; and will not have the Law of Nature,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3642,to be those Rules which conduce to the preservation of mans life on
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3643,earth; but to the attaining of an eternall felicity after death; to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3644,which they think the breach of Covenant may conduce; and consequently
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3645,be just and reasonable; (such are they that think it a work of merit
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3646,"to kill, or depose, or rebell against, the Soveraigne Power constituted"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3647,over them by their own consent.) But because there is no naturall
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3648,knowledge of mans estate after death; much lesse of the reward that is
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3649,then to be given to breach of Faith; but onely a beliefe grounded upon
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3650,"other mens saying, that they know it supernaturally, or that they know"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3651,"those, that knew them, that knew others, that knew it supernaturally;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3652,"Breach of Faith cannot be called a Precept of Reason, or Nature."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3653,Covenants Not Discharged By The Vice Of The Person To Whom Made
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3654,"Others, that allow for a Law of Nature, the keeping of Faith, do"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3655,"neverthelesse make exception of certain persons; as Heretiques, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3656,such as use not to performe their Covenant to others: And this also is
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3657,"against reason. For if any fault of a man, be sufficient to discharge"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3658,our Covenant made; the same ought in reason to have been sufficient to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3659,have hindred the making of it.

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3665,"signifie the Conformity, or Inconformity to Reason, not of Manners, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3666,"manner of life, but of particular Actions. A Just man therefore, is he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3667,"that taketh all the care he can, that his Actions may be all Just: and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3668,"an Unjust man, is he that neglecteth it. And such men are more often"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3669,"in our Language stiled by the names of Righteous, and Unrighteous; then"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3670,"Just, and Unjust; though the meaning be the same. Therefore a Righteous"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3671,"man, does not lose that Title, by one, or a few unjust Actions, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3672,"proceed from sudden Passion, or mistake of Things, or Persons: nor does"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3673,"an Unrighteous man, lose his character, for such Actions, as he does,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3674,"of forbeares to do, for feare: because his Will is not framed by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3675,"Justice, but by the apparant benefit of what he is to do. That which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3676,"gives to humane Actions the relish of Justice, is a certain Noblenesse"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3677,"or Gallantnesse of courage, (rarely found,) by which a man scorns to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3678,"be beholding for the contentment of his life, to fraud, or breach of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3679,"promise. This Justice of the Manners, is that which is meant, where"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3680,Justice is called a Vertue; and Injustice a Vice.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3681,"But the Justice of Actions denominates men, not Just, but Guiltlesse;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3682,"and the Injustice of the same, (which is also called Injury,) gives them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3683,but the name of Guilty.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3684,"Justice Of Manners, And Justice Of Actions"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3685,"Again, the Injustice of Manners, is the disposition, or aptitude to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3686,do Injurie; and is Injustice before it proceed to Act; and without
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3687,supposing any individuall person injured. But the Injustice of an
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3688,"Action, (that is to say Injury,) supposeth an individuall person"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3689,"Injured; namely him, to whom the Covenant was made: And therefore many"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3690,"times the injury is received by one man, when the dammage redoundeth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3691,to another. As when The Master commandeth his servant to give mony to a
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3692,"stranger; if it be not done, the Injury is done to the Master, whom"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3693,he had before Covenanted to obey; but the dammage redoundeth to the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3694,"stranger, to whom he had no Obligation; and therefore could not Injure"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3695,"him. And so also in Common-wealths, private men may remit to one another"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3696,"their debts; but not robberies or other violences, whereby they are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3697,"endammaged; because the detaining of Debt, is an Injury to themselves;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3698,"but Robbery and Violence, are Injuries to the Person of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3699,Common-wealth.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3700,"Nothing Done To A Man, By His Own Consent Can Be Injury"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3701,"Whatsoever is done to a man, conformable to his own Will signified to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3702,"the doer, is no Injury to him. For if he that doeth it, hath not passed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3703,"away his originall right to do what he please, by some Antecedent"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3704,"Covenant, there is no breach of Covenant; and therefore no Injury done"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3705,"him. And if he have; then his Will to have it done being signified, is a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3706,release of that Covenant; and so again there is no Injury done him.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3707,"Justice Commutative, And Distributive"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3708,"Justice of Actions, is by Writers divided into Commutative, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3709,Distributive; and the former they say consisteth in proportion
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3710,Arithmeticall; the later in proportion Geometricall. Commutative
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3711,"therefore, they place in the equality of value of the things contracted"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3712,"for; And Distributive, in the distribution of equall benefit, to men of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3713,equall merit. As if it were Injustice to sell dearer than we buy; or to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3714,give more to a man than he merits. The value of all things contracted
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3715,"for, is measured by the Appetite of the Contractors: and therefore the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3716,"just value, is that which they be contented to give. And Merit (besides"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3717,"that which is by Covenant, where the performance on one part, meriteth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3718,"the performance of the other part, and falls under Justice Commutative,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3719,"not Distributive,) is not due by Justice; but is rewarded of Grace"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3720,"onely. And therefore this distinction, in the sense wherein it useth to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3721,"be expounded, is not right. To speak properly, Commutative Justice,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3722,"is the Justice of a Contractor; that is, a Performance of Covenant,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3723,"in Buying, and Selling; Hiring, and Letting to Hire; Lending, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3724,"Borrowing; Exchanging, Bartering, and other acts of Contract."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3725,"And Distributive Justice, the Justice of an Arbitrator; that is to say,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3726,"the act of defining what is Just. Wherein, (being trusted by them that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3727,"make him Arbitrator,) if he performe his Trust, he is said to distribute"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3728,"to every man his own: and his is indeed Just Distribution, and may"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3729,be called (though improperly) Distributive Justice; but more properly
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3730,"Equity; which also is a Law of Nature, as shall be shewn in due place."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3731,"The Fourth Law Of Nature, Gratitude"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3732,As Justice dependeth on Antecedent Covenant; so does Gratitude depend
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3733,"on Antecedent Grace; that is to say, Antecedent Free-gift: and is the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3734,"fourth Law of Nature; which may be conceived in this Forme, ""That a man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3735,"which receiveth Benefit from another of meer Grace, Endeavour that he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3736,"which giveth it, have no reasonable cause to repent him of his good"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3737,"will."" For no man giveth, but with intention of Good to himselfe;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3738,"because Gift is Voluntary; and of all Voluntary Acts, the Object is to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3739,"every man his own Good; of which if men see they shall be frustrated,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3740,"there will be no beginning of benevolence, or trust; nor consequently of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3741,mutuall help; nor of reconciliation of one man to another; and therefore
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3742,they are to remain still in the condition of War; which is contrary to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3743,"the first and Fundamentall Law of Nature, which commandeth men to Seek"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3744,"Peace. The breach of this Law, is called Ingratitude; and hath the same"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3745,"relation to Grace, that Injustice hath to Obligation by Covenant."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3746,"The Fifth, Mutuall accommodation, or Compleasance"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3747,"A fifth Law of Nature, is COMPLEASANCE; that is to say, ""That every"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3748,"man strive to accommodate himselfe to the rest."" For the understanding"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3749,"whereof, we may consider, that there is in mens aptnesse to Society;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3750,"a diversity of Nature, rising from their diversity of Affections; not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3751,unlike to that we see in stones brought together for building of an

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3758,"for the stubbornness of his Passions, cannot be corrected, is to be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3759,"left, or cast out of Society, as combersome thereunto. For seeing every"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3760,"man, not onely by Right, but also by necessity of Nature, is supposed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3761,"to endeavour all he can, to obtain that which is necessary for his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3762,"conservation; He that shall oppose himselfe against it, for things"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3763,"superfluous, is guilty of the warre that thereupon is to follow; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3764,"therefore doth that, which is contrary to the fundamentall Law of"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3769,"A sixth Law of Nature is this, ""That upon caution of the Future time,"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3798,"inequallity that now is, has been introduced by the Lawes civill. I know"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3804,"consent of men, but by difference of Wit; which is not only against"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3805,"reason; but also against experience. For there are very few so foolish,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3806,"that had not rather governe themselves, than be governed by others:"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3892,"obliged to trust him. And thus also the controversie, and the condition"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3950,"differ not onely in their Judgement, on the senses of what is pleasant,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3951,"and unpleasant to the tast, smell, hearing, touch, and sight; but also"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,15,3952,"of what is conformable, or disagreeable to Reason, in the actions of"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,3978,"CHAPTER XVI. OF PERSONS, AUTHORS, AND THINGS PERSONATED"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,3979,A Person What
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,3980,"A PERSON, is he ""whose words or actions are considered, either as his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,3981,"own, or as representing the words or actions of an other man, or of any"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,3983,"Person Naturall, And Artificiall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,3984,"When they are considered as his owne, then is he called a Naturall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,3985,Person: And when they are considered as representing the words and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,3986,"actions of an other, then is he a Feigned or Artificiall person."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,3987,"The Word Person, Whence"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,3988,"The word Person is latine: instead whereof the Greeks have Prosopon,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,3989,"which signifies the Face, as Persona in latine signifies the Disguise,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,3990,"or Outward Appearance of a man, counterfeited on the Stage; and somtimes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,3991,"more particularly that part of it, which disguiseth the face, as a Mask"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,3992,"or Visard: And from the Stage, hath been translated to any Representer"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,3993,"of speech and action, as well in Tribunalls, as Theaters. So that a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,3994,"Person, is the same that an Actor is, both on the Stage and in common"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,3995,"Conversation; and to Personate, is to Act, or Represent himselfe, or an"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,3996,"other; and he that acteth another, is said to beare his Person, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,3997,"act in his name; (in which sence Cicero useth it where he saies, ""Unus"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4002,the like.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4003,"Actor, Author; Authority"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4004,"Of Persons Artificiall, some have their words and actions Owned by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4005,those whom they represent. And then the Person is the Actor; and he that
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4006,"owneth his words and actions, is the AUTHOR: In which case the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4007,Actor acteth by Authority. For that which in speaking of goods and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4008,"possessions, is called an Owner, and in latine Dominus, in Greeke"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4009,"Kurios; speaking of Actions, is called Author. And as the Right of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4010,"possession, is called Dominion; so the Right of doing any Action, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4011,"called AUTHORITY. So that by Authority, is alwayes understood a Right"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4012,"of doing any act: and Done By Authority, done by Commission, or Licence"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4013,from him whose right it is.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4014,"Covenants By Authority, Bind The Author"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4015,"From hence it followeth, that when the Actor maketh a Covenant by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4016,"Authority, he bindeth thereby the Author, no lesse than if he had made"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4017,it himselfe; and no lesse subjecteth him to all the consequences of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4018,"same. And therfore all that hath been said formerly, (Chap. 14) of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4019,"nature of Covenants between man and man in their naturall capacity,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4020,"is true also when they are made by their Actors, Representers, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4021,"Procurators, that have authority from them, so far-forth as is in their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4022,"Commission, but no farther."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4023,"And therefore he that maketh a Covenant with the Actor, or Representer,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4024,"not knowing the Authority he hath, doth it at his own perill. For no man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4025,"is obliged by a Covenant, whereof he is not Author; nor consequently by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4026,"a Covenant made against, or beside the Authority he gave."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4027,But Not The Actor
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4028,When the Actor doth any thing against the Law of Nature by command of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4029,"the Author, if he be obliged by former Covenant to obey him, not he, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4030,the Author breaketh the Law of Nature: for though the Action be against
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4031,the Law of Nature; yet it is not his: but contrarily; to refuse to do
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4032,"it, is against the Law of Nature, that forbiddeth breach of Covenant."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4033,The Authority Is To Be Shewne
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4034,"And he that maketh a Covenant with the Author, by mediation of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4035,"Actor, not knowing what Authority he hath, but onely takes his word;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4036,"in case such Authority be not made manifest unto him upon demand, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4037,"no longer obliged: For the Covenant made with the Author, is not valid,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4038,"without his Counter-assurance. But if he that so Covenanteth, knew"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4039,"before hand he was to expect no other assurance, than the Actors word;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4040,then is the Covenant valid; because the Actor in this case maketh
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4041,"himselfe the Author. And therefore, as when the Authority is evident,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4042,"the Covenant obligeth the Author, not the Actor; so when the Authority"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4043,"is feigned, it obligeth the Actor onely; there being no Author but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4044,himselfe.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4045,"Things Personated, Inanimate"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4046,"There are few things, that are uncapable of being represented by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4047,"Fiction. Inanimate things, as a Church, an Hospital, a Bridge, may"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4048,"be Personated by a Rector, Master, or Overseer. But things Inanimate,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4049,"cannot be Authors, nor therefore give Authority to their Actors: Yet the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4050,"Actors may have Authority to procure their maintenance, given them by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4051,"those that are Owners, or Governours of those things. And therefore,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4052,"such things cannot be Personated, before there be some state of Civill"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4053,Government.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4054,Irrational
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4055,"Likewise Children, Fooles, and Mad-men that have no use of Reason, may"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4056,"be Personated by Guardians, or Curators; but can be no Authors (during"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4057,"that time) of any action done by them, longer then (when they shall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4058,recover the use of Reason) they shall judge the same reasonable.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4059,"Yet during the Folly, he that hath right of governing them, may give"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4060,Authority to the Guardian. But this again has no place but in a State
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4061,"Civill, because before such estate, there is no Dominion of Persons."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4062,False Gods
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4063,"An Idol, or meer Figment of the brain, my be Personated; as were the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4064,"Gods of the Heathen; which by such Officers as the State appointed, were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4065,"Personated, and held Possessions, and other Goods, and Rights, which men"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4066,"from time to time dedicated, and consecrated unto them. But idols cannot"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4067,be Authors: for a Idol is nothing. The Authority proceeded from the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4068,"State: and therefore before introduction of Civill Government, the Gods"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4069,of the Heathen could not be Personated.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4070,The True God
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4071,"The true God may be Personated. As he was; first, by Moses; who governed"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4073,"name, with Hoc Dicit Moses; but in Gods Name, with Hoc Dicit Dominus."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4074,"Secondly, by the son of man, his own Son our Blessed Saviour Jesus"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4075,"Christ, that came to reduce the Jewes, and induce all Nations into the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4076,"Kingdome of his Father; not as of himselfe, but as sent from his Father."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4077,"And thirdly, by the Holy Ghost, or Comforter, speaking, and working"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4078,"in the Apostles: which Holy Ghost, was a Comforter that came not of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4079,"himselfe; but was sent, and proceeded from them both."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4080,"A Multitude Of Men, How One Person"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4081,"A Multitude of men, are made One Person, when they are by one man, or"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4083,every one of that Multitude in particular. For it is the Unity of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4084,"Representer, not the Unity of the Represented, that maketh the Person"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4085,"One. And it is the Representer that beareth the Person, and but one"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4087,Every One Is Author
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4088,"And because the Multitude naturally is not One, but Many; they cannot"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4096,An Actor May Be Many Men Made One By Plurality Of Voyces
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4097,"And if the Representative consist of many men, the voyce of the greater"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4100,"the Negative, there will be Negatives more than enough to destroy"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4103,"Representatives, When The Number Is Even, Unprofitable"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4104,"And a Representative of even number, especially when the number is"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4106,"therefore oftentimes mute, and uncapable of Action. Yet in some cases"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4107,"contradictory voyces equall in number, may determine a question; as in"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4110,"not. For when a Cause is heard; not to condemne, is to absolve; but on"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4111,"the contrary, to say that not absolving, is condemning, is not true. The"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4112,"like it is in a deliberation of executing presently, or deferring"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4123,Of Authors there be two sorts. The first simply so called; which I have
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4124,"before defined to be him, that owneth the Action of another simply."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4125,"The second is he, that owneth an Action, or Covenant of another"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4126,"conditionally; that is to say, he undertaketh to do it, if the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4127,"other doth it not, at, or before a certain time. And these Authors"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4128,"conditionall, are generally called SURETYES, in Latine Fidejussores, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4129,"Sponsores; and particularly for Debt, Praedes; and for Appearance before"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,16,4130,"a Judge, or Magistrate, Vades."

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4133,COMMON-WEALTH

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4136,"and Dominion over others,) in the introduction of that restraint upon"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4137,"themselves, (in which wee see them live in Common-wealths,) is the"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4141,"to the naturall Passions of men, when there is no visible Power to keep"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4143,"their Covenants, and observation of these Lawes of Nature set down in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4144,the fourteenth and fifteenth Chapters.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4145,Which Is Not To Be Had From The Law Of Nature:
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4146,"For the Lawes of Nature (as Justice, Equity, Modesty, Mercy, and (in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4147,"summe) Doing To Others, As Wee Would Be Done To,) if themselves, without"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4148,"the terrour of some Power, to cause them to be observed, are contrary to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4149,"our naturall Passions, that carry us to Partiality, Pride, Revenge, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4150,"the like. And Covenants, without the Sword, are but Words, and of no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4151,strength to secure a man at all. Therefore notwithstanding the Lawes of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4152,"Nature, (which every one hath then kept, when he has the will to keep"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4153,"them, when he can do it safely,) if there be no Power erected, or not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4154,great enough for our security; every man will and may lawfully rely on
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4155,"his own strength and art, for caution against all other men. And in all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4156,"places, where men have lived by small Families, to robbe and spoyle one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4157,"another, has been a Trade, and so farre from being reputed against the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4158,"Law of Nature, that the greater spoyles they gained, the greater was"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4159,"their honour; and men observed no other Lawes therein, but the Lawes of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4160,"Honour; that is, to abstain from cruelty, leaving to men their lives,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4161,and instruments of husbandry. And as small Familyes did then; so now
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4162,do Cities and Kingdomes which are but greater Families (for their own
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4163,"security) enlarge their Dominions, upon all pretences of danger, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4164,"fear of Invasion, or assistance that may be given to Invaders, endeavour"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4165,"as much as they can, to subdue, or weaken their neighbours, by open"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4166,"force, and secret arts, for want of other Caution, justly; and are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4167,rememdbred for it in after ages with honour.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4168,Nor From The Conjunction Of A Few Men Or Familyes
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4169,"Nor is it the joyning together of a small number of men, that gives them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4170,"this security; because in small numbers, small additions on the one side"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4171,"or the other, make the advantage of strength so great, as is sufficient"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4172,to carry the Victory; and therefore gives encouragement to an Invasion.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4173,"The Multitude sufficient to confide in for our Security, is not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4174,"determined by any certain number, but by comparison with the Enemy we"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4175,"feare; and is then sufficient, when the odds of the Enemy is not of so"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4176,"visible and conspicuous moment, to determine the event of warre, as to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4177,move him to attempt.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4178,"Nor From A Great Multitude, Unlesse Directed By One Judgement"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4179,And be there never so great a Multitude; yet if their actions be
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4180,"directed according to their particular judgements, and particular"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4181,"appetites, they can expect thereby no defence, nor protection, neither"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4182,"against a Common enemy, nor against the injuries of one another. For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4183,being distracted in opinions concerning the best use and application
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4184,"of their strength, they do not help, but hinder one another; and reduce"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4185,their strength by mutuall opposition to nothing: whereby they are
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4186,"easily, not onely subdued by a very few that agree together; but also"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4187,"when there is no common enemy, they make warre upon each other, for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4188,their particular interests. For if we could suppose a great Multitude of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4189,"men to consent in the observation of Justice, and other Lawes of Nature,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4190,without a common Power to keep them all in awe; we might as well suppose
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4191,all Man-kind to do the same; and then there neither would be nor need to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4192,"be any Civill Government, or Common-wealth at all; because there would"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4193,be Peace without subjection.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4194,And That Continually
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4195,"Nor is it enough for the security, which men desire should last all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4196,"the time of their life, that they be governed, and directed by one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4197,"judgement, for a limited time; as in one Battell, or one Warre. For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4198,though they obtain a Victory by their unanimous endeavour against a
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4199,"forraign enemy; yet afterwards, when either they have no common enemy,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4200,"or he that by one part is held for an enemy, is by another part held for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4201,"a friend, they must needs by the difference of their interests dissolve,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4202,and fall again into a Warre amongst themselves.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4203,"Why Certain Creatures Without Reason, Or Speech,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4204,"Do Neverthelesse Live In Society, Without Any Coercive Power"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4205,"It is true, that certain living creatures, as Bees, and Ants, live"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4206,"sociably one with another, (which are therefore by Aristotle numbred"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4207,"amongst Politicall creatures;) and yet have no other direction, than"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4208,"their particular judgements and appetites; nor speech, whereby one of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4209,"them can signifie to another, what he thinks expedient for the common"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4210,"benefit: and therefore some man may perhaps desire to know, why Man-kind"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4211,"cannot do the same. To which I answer,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4212,"First, that men are continually in competition for Honour and Dignity,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4213,which these creatures are not; and consequently amongst men there
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4214,"ariseth on that ground, Envy and Hatred, and finally Warre; but amongst"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4215,these not so.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4216,"Secondly, that amongst these creatures, the Common good differeth not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4217,"from the Private; and being by nature enclined to their private, they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4218,"procure thereby the common benefit. But man, whose Joy consisteth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4219,"in comparing himselfe with other men, can relish nothing but what is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4220,eminent.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4221,"Thirdly, that these creatures, having not (as man) the use of reason,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4222,"do not see, nor think they see any fault, in the administration of their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4223,"common businesse: whereas amongst men, there are very many, that thinke"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4224,"themselves wiser, and abler to govern the Publique, better than the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4225,"rest; and these strive to reforme and innovate, one this way, another"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4226,that way; and thereby bring it into Distraction and Civill warre.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4227,"Fourthly, that these creatures, though they have some use of voice, in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4228,"making knowne to one another their desires, and other affections; yet"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4229,"they want that art of words, by which some men can represent to others,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4230,"that which is Good, in the likenesse of Evill; and Evill, in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4231,"likenesse of Good; and augment, or diminish the apparent greatnesse of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4232,"Good and Evill; discontenting men, and troubling their Peace at their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4233,pleasure.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4234,"Fiftly, irrationall creatures cannot distinguish betweene Injury, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4235,"Dammage; and therefore as long as they be at ease, they are not offended"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4236,"with their fellowes: whereas Man is then most troublesome, when he is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4237,"most at ease: for then it is that he loves to shew his Wisdome, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4238,controule the Actions of them that governe the Common-wealth.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4239,"Lastly, the agreement of these creatures is Naturall; that of men, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4240,"by Covenant only, which is Artificiall: and therefore it is no wonder"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4241,if there be somewhat else required (besides Covenant) to make their
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4242,"Agreement constant and lasting; which is a Common Power, to keep them in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4243,"awe, and to direct their actions to the Common Benefit."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4244,The Generation Of A Common-wealth
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4245,"The only way to erect such a Common Power, as may be able to defend them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4246,"from the invasion of Forraigners, and the injuries of one another, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4247,"thereby to secure them in such sort, as that by their owne industrie,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4248,"and by the fruites of the Earth, they may nourish themselves and live"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4249,"contentedly; is, to conferre all their power and strength upon one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4250,"Man, or upon one Assembly of men, that may reduce all their Wills,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4251,"by plurality of voices, unto one Will: which is as much as to say, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4252,"appoint one man, or Assembly of men, to beare their Person; and every"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4253,"one to owne, and acknowledge himselfe to be Author of whatsoever he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4254,"that so beareth their Person, shall Act, or cause to be Acted, in those"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4255,things which concerne the Common Peace and Safetie; and therein to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4256,"submit their Wills, every one to his Will, and their Judgements, to his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4257,"Judgment. This is more than Consent, or Concord; it is a reall Unitie of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4258,"them all, in one and the same Person, made by Covenant of every man with"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4259,"every man, in such manner, as if every man should say to every man, ""I"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4260,"Authorise and give up my Right of Governing my selfe, to this Man, or to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4261,"this Assembly of men, on this condition, that thou give up thy Right"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4262,"to him, and Authorise all his Actions in like manner."" This done, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4263,"Multitude so united in one Person, is called a COMMON-WEALTH, in latine"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4264,"CIVITAS. This is the Generation of that great LEVIATHAN, or rather (to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4265,"speake more reverently) of that Mortall God, to which wee owe under the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4266,"Immortall God, our peace and defence. For by this Authoritie, given him"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4267,"by every particular man in the Common-Wealth, he hath the use of so"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4268,"much Power and Strength conferred on him, that by terror thereof, he is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4269,"inabled to forme the wills of them all, to Peace at home, and mutuall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4270,ayd against their enemies abroad.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4271,The Definition Of A Common-wealth
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4272,And in him consisteth the Essence of the Common-wealth; which (to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4273,"define it,) is ""One Person, of whose Acts a great Multitude, by mutuall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4274,"Covenants one with another, have made themselves every one the Author,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4275,"to the end he may use the strength and means of them all, as he shall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4276,"think expedient, for their Peace and Common Defence."""
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4277,"Soveraigne, And Subject, What"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4278,"And he that carryeth this Person, as called SOVERAIGNE, and said to have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4279,"Soveraigne Power; and every one besides, his SUBJECT."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4280,"The attaining to this Soveraigne Power, is by two wayes. One, by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4281,"Naturall force; as when a man maketh his children, to submit themselves,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4282,"and their children to his government, as being able to destroy them if"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4283,"they refuse, or by Warre subdueth his enemies to his will, giving them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4284,"their lives on that condition. The other, is when men agree amongst"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4285,"themselves, to submit to some Man, or Assembly of men, voluntarily, on"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4286,"confidence to be protected by him against all others. This later, may be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4287,"called a Politicall Common-wealth, or Common-wealth by Institution; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4288,"the former, a Common-wealth by Acquisition. And first, I shall speak of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,17,4289,a Common-wealth by Institution.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4290,CHAPTER XVIII. OF THE RIGHTS OF SOVERAIGNES BY INSTITUTION
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4291,"The Act Of Instituting A Common-wealth, What"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4292,"A Common-wealth is said to be Instituted, when a Multitude of men do"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4293,"Agree, and Covenant, Every One With Every One, that to whatsoever Man,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4294,"or Assembly Of Men, shall be given by the major part, the Right"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4295,"to Present the Person of them all, (that is to say, to be their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4296,"Representative;) every one, as well he that Voted For It, as he that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4297,"Voted Against It, shall Authorise all the Actions and Judgements, of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4298,"that Man, or Assembly of men, in the same manner, as if they were his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4299,"own, to the end, to live peaceably amongst themselves, and be protected"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4300,against other men.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4301,"The Consequences To Such Institution, Are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4302,I. The Subjects Cannot Change The Forme Of Government
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4303,"From this Institution of a Common-wealth are derived all the Rights, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4304,"Facultyes of him, or them, on whom the Soveraigne Power is conferred by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4305,the consent of the People assembled.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4306,"First, because they Covenant, it is to be understood, they are not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4307,obliged by former Covenant to any thing repugnant hereunto. And
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4308,"Consequently they that have already Instituted a Common-wealth, being"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4309,"thereby bound by Covenant, to own the Actions, and Judgements of one,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4310,"cannot lawfully make a new Covenant, amongst themselves, to be obedient"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4311,"to any other, in any thing whatsoever, without his permission. And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4312,"therefore, they that are subjects to a Monarch, cannot without his leave"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4313,"cast off Monarchy, and return to the confusion of a disunited Multitude;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4314,"nor transferre their Person from him that beareth it, to another Man,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4315,"or other Assembly of men: for they are bound, every man to every man,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4316,"to Own, and be reputed Author of all, that he that already is their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4317,"Soveraigne, shall do, and judge fit to be done: so that any one man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4318,"dissenting, all the rest should break their Covenant made to that man,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4319,which is injustice: and they have also every man given the Soveraignty
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4320,"to him that beareth their Person; and therefore if they depose him,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4321,"they take from him that which is his own, and so again it is injustice."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4322,"Besides, if he that attempteth to depose his Soveraign, be killed, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4323,"punished by him for such attempt, he is author of his own punishment,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4324,"as being by the Institution, Author of all his Soveraign shall do: And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4325,"because it is injustice for a man to do any thing, for which he may be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4326,"punished by his own authority, he is also upon that title, unjust."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4327,And whereas some men have pretended for their disobedience to their
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4328,"Soveraign, a new Covenant, made, not with men, but with God; this also"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4329,"is unjust: for there is no Covenant with God, but by mediation of some"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4330,"body that representeth Gods Person; which none doth but Gods Lieutenant,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4331,who hath the Soveraignty under God. But this pretence of Covenant with
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4332,"God, is so evident a lye, even in the pretenders own consciences, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4333,"it is not onely an act of an unjust, but also of a vile, and unmanly"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4334,disposition.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4335,2. Soveraigne Power Cannot Be Forfeited
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4336,"Secondly, Because the Right of bearing the Person of them all, is given"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4337,"to him they make Soveraigne, by Covenant onely of one to another, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4338,not of him to any of them; there can happen no breach of Covenant on the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4339,"part of the Soveraigne; and consequently none of his Subjects, by any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4340,"pretence of forfeiture, can be freed from his Subjection. That he which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4341,"is made Soveraigne maketh no Covenant with his Subjects beforehand, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4342,"manifest; because either he must make it with the whole multitude, as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4343,one party to the Covenant; or he must make a severall Covenant with
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4344,"every man. With the whole, as one party, it is impossible; because as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4345,yet they are not one Person: and if he make so many severall Covenants
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4346,"as there be men, those Covenants after he hath the Soveraignty are voyd,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4347,because what act soever can be pretended by any one of them for breach
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4348,"thereof, is the act both of himselfe, and of all the rest, because done"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4349,"in the Person, and by the Right of every one of them in particular."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4350,"Besides, if any one, or more of them, pretend a breach of the Covenant"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4351,"made by the Soveraigne at his Institution; and others, or one other of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4352,"his Subjects, or himselfe alone, pretend there was no such breach,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4353,"there is in this case, no Judge to decide the controversie: it returns"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4354,therefore to the Sword again; and every man recovereth the right of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4355,"Protecting himselfe by his own strength, contrary to the designe they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4356,had in the Institution. It is therefore in vain to grant Soveraignty by
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4357,way of precedent Covenant. The opinion that any Monarch receiveth his
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4358,"Power by Covenant, that is to say on Condition, proceedeth from want"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4359,"of understanding this easie truth, that Covenants being but words, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4360,"breath, have no force to oblige, contain, constrain, or protect any man,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4361,"but what it has from the publique Sword; that is, from the untyed hands"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4362,"of that Man, or Assembly of men that hath the Soveraignty, and whose"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4363,"actions are avouched by them all, and performed by the strength of them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4364,"all, in him united. But when an Assembly of men is made Soveraigne; then"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4365,no man imagineth any such Covenant to have past in the Institution; for
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4366,"no man is so dull as to say, for example, the People of Rome, made"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4367,"a Covenant with the Romans, to hold the Soveraignty on such or such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4368,"conditions; which not performed, the Romans might lawfully depose the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4369,"Roman People. That men see not the reason to be alike in a Monarchy, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4370,"in a Popular Government, proceedeth from the ambition of some, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4371,"are kinder to the government of an Assembly, whereof they may hope to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4372,"participate, than of Monarchy, which they despair to enjoy."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4373,3. No Man Can Without Injustice Protest Against The
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4374,"Institution Of The Soveraigne Declared By The Major Part. Thirdly,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4375,because the major part hath by consenting voices declared a Soveraigne;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4376,"he that dissented must now consent with the rest; that is, be contented"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4377,"to avow all the actions he shall do, or else justly be destroyed by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4378,rest. For if he voluntarily entered into the Congregation of them that
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4379,"were assembled, he sufficiently declared thereby his will (and therefore"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4380,tacitely covenanted) to stand to what the major part should ordayne: and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4381,"therefore if he refuse to stand thereto, or make Protestation against"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4382,"any of their Decrees, he does contrary to his Covenant, and therfore"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4383,"unjustly. And whether he be of the Congregation, or not; and whether his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4384,"consent be asked, or not, he must either submit to their decrees, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4385,be left in the condition of warre he was in before; wherein he might
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4386,without injustice be destroyed by any man whatsoever.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4387,4. The Soveraigns Actions Cannot Be Justly Accused By The Subject
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4388,"Fourthly, because every Subject is by this Institution Author of all the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4389,"Actions, and Judgements of the Soveraigne Instituted; it followes, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4390,"whatsoever he doth, it can be no injury to any of his Subjects; nor"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4391,ought he to be by any of them accused of Injustice. For he that doth any
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4392,"thing by authority from another, doth therein no injury to him by whose"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4393,"authority he acteth: But by this Institution of a Common-wealth, every"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4394,particular man is Author of all the Soveraigne doth; and consequently
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4395,"he that complaineth of injury from his Soveraigne, complaineth of that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4396,whereof he himselfe is Author; and therefore ought not to accuse any man
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4397,but himselfe; no nor himselfe of injury; because to do injury to ones
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4398,"selfe, is impossible. It is true that they that have Soveraigne"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4399,"power, may commit Iniquity; but not Injustice, or Injury in the proper"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4400,signification.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4401,"5. What Soever The Soveraigne Doth, Is Unpunishable By The Subject"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4402,"Fiftly, and consequently to that which was sayd last, no man that hath"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4403,"Soveraigne power can justly be put to death, or otherwise in any manner"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4404,by his Subjects punished. For seeing every Subject is author of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4405,"actions of his Soveraigne; he punisheth another, for the actions"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4406,committed by himselfe.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4407,6. The Soveraigne Is Judge Of What Is Necessary For The Peace
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4408,And Defence Of His Subjects
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4409,"And because the End of this Institution, is the Peace and Defence of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4410,"them all; and whosoever has right to the End, has right to the Means;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4411,"it belongeth of Right, to whatsoever Man, or Assembly that hath the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4412,"Soveraignty, to be Judge both of the meanes of Peace and Defence;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4413,"and also of the hindrances, and disturbances of the same; and to do"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4414,"whatsoever he shall think necessary to be done, both beforehand, for the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4415,"preserving of Peace and Security, by prevention of discord at home and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4416,"Hostility from abroad; and, when Peace and Security are lost, for the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4417,"recovery of the same. And therefore,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4418,And Judge Of What Doctrines Are Fit To Be Taught Them
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4419,"Sixtly, it is annexed to the Soveraignty, to be Judge of what Opinions"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4420,"and Doctrines are averse, and what conducing to Peace; and consequently,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4421,"on what occasions, how farre, and what, men are to be trusted withall,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4422,in speaking to Multitudes of people; and who shall examine the Doctrines
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4423,of all bookes before they be published. For the Actions of men proceed
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4424,"from their Opinions; and in the wel governing of Opinions, consisteth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4425,"the well governing of mens Actions, in order to their Peace, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4426,"Concord. And though in matter of Doctrine, nothing ought to be regarded"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4427,but the Truth; yet this is not repugnant to regulating of the same by
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4428,"Peace. For Doctrine Repugnant to Peace, can no more be True, than Peace"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4429,"and Concord can be against the Law of Nature. It is true, that in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4430,"a Common-wealth, where by the negligence, or unskilfullnesse of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4431,"Governours, and Teachers, false Doctrines are by time generally"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4432,received; the contrary Truths may be generally offensive; Yet the most
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4433,"sudden, and rough busling in of a new Truth, that can be, does never"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4434,"breake the Peace, but onely somtimes awake the Warre. For those men that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4435,"are so remissely governed, that they dare take up Armes, to defend, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4436,"introduce an Opinion, are still in Warre; and their condition not Peace,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4437,but only a Cessation of Armes for feare of one another; and they live
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4438,"as it were, in the procincts of battaile continually. It belongeth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4439,"therefore to him that hath the Soveraign Power, to be Judge, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4440,"constitute all Judges of Opinions and Doctrines, as a thing necessary to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4441,"Peace, thereby to prevent Discord and Civill Warre."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4442,"7. The Right Of Making Rules, Whereby The Subject May"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4443,"Every Man Know What Is So His Owne, As No Other Subject"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4444,Can Without Injustice Take It From Him
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4445,"Seventhly, is annexed to the Soveraigntie, the whole power of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4446,"prescribing the Rules, whereby every man may know, what Goods he may"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4447,"enjoy and what Actions he may doe, without being molested by any of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4448,his fellow Subjects: And this is it men Call Propriety. For before
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4449,constitution of Soveraign Power (as hath already been shewn) all men had
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4450,right to all things; which necessarily causeth Warre: and therefore this
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4451,"Proprietie, being necessary to Peace, and depending on Soveraign Power,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4452,"is the Act of the Power, in order to the publique peace. These Rules of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4453,"Propriety (or Meum and Tuum) and of Good, Evill, Lawfull and Unlawfull"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4454,"in the actions of subjects, are the Civill Lawes, that is to say, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4455,lawes of each Commonwealth in particular; though the name of Civill Law
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4456,be now restrained to the antient Civill Lawes of the City of Rome; which
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4457,"being the head of a great part of the World, her Lawes at that time were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4458,in these parts the Civill Law.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4459,8. To Him Also Belongeth The Right Of All Judicature
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4460,And Decision Of Controversies:
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4461,"Eightly, is annexed to the Soveraigntie, the Right of Judicature; that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4462,"is to say, of hearing and deciding all Controversies, which may arise"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4463,"concerning Law, either Civill, or naturall, or concerning Fact. For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4464,"without the decision of Controversies, there is no protection of one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4465,"Subject, against the injuries of another; the Lawes concerning Meum and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4466,"Tuum are in vaine; and to every man remaineth, from the naturall and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4467,"necessary appetite of his own conservation, the right of protecting"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4468,"himselfe by his private strength, which is the condition of Warre; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4469,contrary to the end for which every Common-wealth is instituted.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4470,"9. And Of Making War, And Peace, As He Shall Think Best:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4471,"Ninthly, is annexed to the Soveraignty, the Right of making Warre, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4472,"Peace with other Nations, and Common-wealths; that is to say, of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4473,"Judging when it is for the publique good, and how great forces are to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4474,"be assembled, armed, and payd for that end; and to levy mony upon the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4475,"Subjects, to defray the expenses thereof. For the Power by which the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4476,"people are to be defended, consisteth in their Armies; and the strength"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4477,"of an Army, in the union of their strength under one Command; which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4478,"Command the Soveraign Instituted, therefore hath; because the command"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4479,"of the Militia, without other Institution, maketh him that hath it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4480,"Soveraign. And therefore whosoever is made Generall of an Army, he that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4481,hath the Soveraign Power is alwayes Generallissimo.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4482,"10. And Of Choosing All Counsellours, And Ministers,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4483,"Both Of Peace, And Warre:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4484,"Tenthly, is annexed to the Soveraignty, the choosing of all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4485,"Councellours, Ministers, Magistrates, and Officers, both in peace, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4486,"War. For seeing the Soveraign is charged with the End, which is the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4487,common Peace and Defence; he is understood to have Power to use such
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4488,"Means, as he shall think most fit for his discharge."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4489,"11. And Of Rewarding, And Punishing, And That (Where No"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4490,Former Law hath Determined The Measure Of It) Arbitrary:
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4491,"Eleventhly, to the Soveraign is committed the Power of Rewarding"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4492,"with riches, or honour; and of Punishing with corporall, or pecuniary"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4493,"punishment, or with ignominy every Subject according to the Lawe he hath"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4494,"formerly made; or if there be no Law made, according as he shall judge"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4495,"most to conduce to the encouraging of men to serve the Common-wealth, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4496,deterring of them from doing dis-service to the same.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4497,12. And Of Honour And Order
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4498,"Lastly, considering what values men are naturally apt to set upon"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4499,themselves; what respect they look for from others; and how little they
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4500,"value other men; from whence continually arise amongst them, Emulation,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4501,"Quarrells, Factions, and at last Warre, to the destroying of one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4502,"another, and diminution of their strength against a Common Enemy; It"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4503,"is necessary that there be Lawes of Honour, and a publique rate of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4504,"worth of such men as have deserved, or are able to deserve well of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4505,"Common-wealth; and that there be force in the hands of some or other, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4506,"put those Lawes in execution. But it hath already been shown, that not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4507,"onely the whole Militia, or forces of the Common-wealth; but also the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4508,"Judicature of all Controversies, is annexed to the Soveraignty. To the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4509,Soveraign therefore it belongeth also to give titles of Honour; and to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4510,"appoint what Order of place, and dignity, each man shall hold; and what"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4511,"signes of respect, in publique or private meetings, they shall give to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4512,one another.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4513,These Rights Are Indivisible
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4514,"These are the Rights, which make the Essence of Soveraignty; and which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4515,"are the markes, whereby a man may discern in what Man, or Assembly"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4516,"of men, the Soveraign Power is placed, and resideth. For these are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4517,"incommunicable, and inseparable. The Power to coyn Mony; to dispose of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4518,the estate and persons of Infant heires; to have praeemption in
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4519,"Markets; and all other Statute Praerogatives, may be transferred by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4520,Soveraign; and yet the Power to protect his Subject be retained. But if
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4521,"he transferre the Militia, he retains the Judicature in vain, for want"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4522,of execution of the Lawes; Or if he grant away the Power of raising
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4523,Mony; the Militia is in vain: or if he give away the government of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4524,"doctrines, men will be frighted into rebellion with the feare of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4525,"Spirits. And so if we consider any one of the said Rights, we shall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4526,"presently see, that the holding of all the rest, will produce no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4527,"effect, in the conservation of Peace and Justice, the end for which all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4528,"Common-wealths are Instituted. And this division is it, whereof it is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4529,"said, ""A kingdome divided in it selfe cannot stand:"" For unlesse this"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4530,"division precede, division into opposite Armies can never happen. If"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4531,there had not first been an opinion received of the greatest part of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4532,"England, that these Powers were divided between the King, and the Lords,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4533,"and the House of Commons, the people had never been divided, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4534,fallen into this Civill Warre; first between those that disagreed
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4535,in Politiques; and after between the Dissenters about the liberty of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4536,"Religion; which have so instructed men in this point of Soveraign Right,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4537,"that there be few now (in England,) that do not see, that these Rights"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4538,"are inseparable, and will be so generally acknowledged, at the next"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4539,"return of Peace; and so continue, till their miseries are forgotten; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4540,"no longer, except the vulgar be better taught than they have hetherto"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4541,been.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4542,And Can By No Grant Passe Away Without Direct
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4543,Renouncing Of The Soveraign Power
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4544,"And because they are essentiall and inseparable Rights, it follows"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4545,"necessarily, that in whatsoever, words any of them seem to be granted"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4546,"away, yet if the Soveraign Power it selfe be not in direct termes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4547,"renounced, and the name of Soveraign no more given by the Grantees to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4548,"him that Grants them, the Grant is voyd: for when he has granted all he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4549,"can, if we grant back the Soveraignty, all is restored, as inseparably"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4550,annexed thereunto.

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4554,"Soveraignty, there is little ground for the opinion of them, that say of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4555,"Soveraign Kings, though they be Singulis Majores, of greater Power than"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4556,"every one of their Subjects, yet they be Universis Minores, of lesse"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4557,"power than them all together. For if by All Together, they mean not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4558,"the collective body as one person, then All Together, and Every One,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4559,"signifie the same; and the speech is absurd. But if by All Together,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4560,"they understand them as one Person (which person the Soveraign bears,)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4561,"then the power of all together, is the same with the Soveraigns power;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4562,"and so again the speech is absurd; which absurdity they see well enough,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4563,when the Soveraignty is in an Assembly of the people; but in a Monarch
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4564,they see it not; and yet the power of Soveraignty is the same in
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4565,whomsoever it be placed.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4566,"And as the Power, so also the Honour of the Soveraign, ought to be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4567,"greater, than that of any, or all the Subjects. For in the Soveraignty"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4568,"is the fountain of Honour. The dignities of Lord, Earle, Duke, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4569,"Prince are his Creatures. As in the presence of the Master, the Servants"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4570,"are equall, and without any honour at all; So are the Subjects, in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4571,"presence of the Soveraign. And though they shine some more, some lesse,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4572,"when they are out of his sight; yet in his presence, they shine no more"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4573,than the Starres in presence of the Sun.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4574,"Soveraigne Power Not Hurtfull As The Want Of It,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4575,And The Hurt Proceeds For The Greatest Part From Not
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4576,"Submitting Readily, To A Lesse"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4577,"But a man may here object, that the Condition of Subjects is very"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4578,"miserable; as being obnoxious to the lusts, and other irregular passions"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4579,"of him, or them that have so unlimited a Power in their hands. And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4580,"commonly they that live under a Monarch, think it the fault of Monarchy;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4581,"and they that live under the government of Democracy, or other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4582,"Soveraign Assembly, attribute all the inconvenience to that forme of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4583,"Common-wealth; whereas the Power in all formes, if they be perfect"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4584,"enough to protect them, is the same; not considering that the estate"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4585,of Man can never be without some incommodity or other; and that the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4586,"greatest, that in any forme of Government can possibly happen to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4587,"people in generall, is scarce sensible, in respect of the miseries, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4588,"horrible calamities, that accompany a Civill Warre; or that dissolute"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4589,"condition of masterlesse men, without subjection to Lawes, and a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4590,"coercive Power to tye their hands from rapine, and revenge: nor"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4591,"considering that the greatest pressure of Soveraign Governours,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4592,"proceedeth not from any delight, or profit they can expect in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4593,"dammage, or weakening of their subjects, in whose vigor, consisteth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4594,"their own selves, that unwillingly contributing to their own defence,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4595,make it necessary for their Governours to draw from them what they can
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4596,"in time of Peace, that they may have means on any emergent occasion, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4597,"sudden need, to resist, or take advantage on their Enemies. For all men"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4598,"are by nature provided of notable multiplying glasses, (that is their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4599,"Passions and Self-love,) through which, every little payment appeareth a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4600,"great grievance; but are destitute of those prospective glasses, (namely"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4601,"Morall and Civill Science,) to see a farre off the miseries that hang"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,18,4602,"over them, and cannot without such payments be avoyded."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4603,"CHAPTER XIX. OF THE SEVERALL KINDS OF COMMON-WEALTH BY INSTITUTION,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4604,AND OF SUCCESSION TO THE SOVERAIGNE POWER
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4605,The Different Formes Of Common-wealths But Three
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4606,"The difference of Common-wealths, consisteth in the difference of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4607,"Soveraign, or the Person representative of all and every one of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4608,"Multitude. And because the Soveraignty is either in one Man, or in an"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4609,Assembly of more than one; and into that Assembly either Every man hath
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4610,"right to enter, or not every one, but Certain men distinguished from the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4611,"rest; it is manifest, there can be but Three kinds of Common-wealth. For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4612,"the Representative must needs be One man, or More: and if more, then it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4613,"is the Assembly of All, or but of a Part. When the Representative is One"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4614,"man, then is the Common-wealth a MONARCHY: when an Assembly of All that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4615,"will come together, then it is a DEMOCRACY, or Popular Common-wealth:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4616,"when an Assembly of a Part onely, then it is called an ARISTOCRACY."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4617,"Other kind of Common-wealth there can be none: for either One, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4618,"More, or All must have the Soveraign Power (which I have shewn to be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4619,indivisible) entire.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4620,"Tyranny And Oligarchy, But Different Names Of Monarchy, And Aristocracy"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4621,"There be other names of Government, in the Histories, and books of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4622,"Policy; as Tyranny, and Oligarchy: But they are not the names of other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4623,"Formes of Government, but of the same Formes misliked. For they that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4624,"are discontented under Monarchy, call it Tyranny; and they that are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4625,"displeased with Aristocracy, called it Oligarchy: so also, they which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4626,"find themselves grieved under a Democracy, call it Anarchy, (which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4627,"signifies want of Government;) and yet I think no man believes, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4628,"want of Government, is any new kind of Government: nor by the same"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4629,"reason ought they to believe, that the Government is of one kind, when"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4630,"they like it, and another, when they mislike it, or are oppressed by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4631,Governours.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4632,Subordinate Representatives Dangerous
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4633,"It is manifest, that men who are in absolute liberty, may, if they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4634,"please, give Authority to One Man, to represent them every one; as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4635,well as give such Authority to any Assembly of men whatsoever; and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4636,"consequently may subject themselves, if they think good, to a Monarch,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4637,"as absolutely, as to any other Representative. Therefore, where there is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4638,"already erected a Soveraign Power, there can be no other Representative"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4639,"of the same people, but onely to certain particular ends, by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4640,Soveraign limited. For that were to erect two Soveraigns; and every
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4641,"man to have his person represented by two Actors, that by opposing one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4642,"another, must needs divide that Power, which (if men will live in Peace)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4643,"is indivisible, and thereby reduce the Multitude into the condition of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4644,"Warre, contrary to the end for which all Soveraignty is instituted. And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4645,"therefore as it is absurd, to think that a Soveraign Assembly, inviting"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4646,"the People of their Dominion, to send up their Deputies, with power"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4647,"to make known their Advise, or Desires, should therefore hold such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4648,"Deputies, rather than themselves, for the absolute Representative of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4649,"the people: so it is absurd also, to think the same in a Monarchy. And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4650,"I know not how this so manifest a truth, should of late be so little"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4651,"observed; that in a Monarchy, he that had the Soveraignty from a descent"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4652,"of 600 years, was alone called Soveraign, had the title of Majesty from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4653,"every one of his Subjects, and was unquestionably taken by them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4654,for their King; was notwithstanding never considered as their
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4655,Representative; that name without contradiction passing for the title
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4656,"of those men, which at his command were sent up by the people to carry"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4657,"their Petitions, and give him (if he permitted it) their advise. Which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4658,"may serve as an admonition, for those that are the true, and absolute"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4659,"Representative of a People, to instruct men in the nature of that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4660,"Office, and to take heed how they admit of any other generall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4661,"Representation upon any occasion whatsoever, if they mean to discharge"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4662,the truth committed to them.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4663,"Comparison Of Monarchy, With Soveraign Assemblyes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4664,"The difference between these three kindes of Common-wealth, consisteth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4665,"not in the difference of Power; but in the difference of Convenience, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4666,"Aptitude to produce the Peace, and Security of the people; for which end"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4667,"they were instituted. And to compare Monarchy with the other two, we may"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4668,"observe; First, that whosoever beareth the Person of the people, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4669,"is one of that Assembly that bears it, beareth also his own naturall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4670,Person. And though he be carefull in his politique Person to procure
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4671,"the common interest; yet he is more, or no lesse carefull to procure the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4672,"private good of himselfe, his family, kindred and friends; and for the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4673,"most part, if the publique interest chance to crosse the private, he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4674,"preferrs the private: for the Passions of men, are commonly more potent"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4675,"than their Reason. From whence it follows, that where the publique and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4676,"private interest are most closely united, there is the publique most"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4677,"advanced. Now in Monarchy, the private interest is the same with the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4678,"publique. The riches, power, and honour of a Monarch arise onely from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4679,"the riches, strength and reputation of his Subjects. For no King can"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4680,"be rich, nor glorious, nor secure; whose Subjects are either poore, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4681,"contemptible, or too weak through want, or dissention, to maintain a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4682,"war against their enemies: Whereas in a Democracy, or Aristocracy, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4683,publique prosperity conferres not so much to the private fortune of one
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4684,"that is corrupt, or ambitious, as doth many times a perfidious advice, a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4685,"treacherous action, or a Civill warre."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4686,"Secondly, that a Monarch receiveth counsell of whom, when, and where he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4687,pleaseth; and consequently may heare the opinion of men versed in the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4688,"matter about which he deliberates, of what rank or quality soever, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4689,"as long before the time of action, and with as much secrecy, as he will."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4690,"But when a Soveraigne Assembly has need of Counsell, none are admitted"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4691,but such as have a Right thereto from the beginning; which for the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4692,most part are of those who have beene versed more in the acquisition
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4693,of Wealth than of Knowledge; and are to give their advice in long
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4694,"discourses, which may, and do commonly excite men to action, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4695,not governe them in it. For the Understanding is by the flame of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4696,"Passions, never enlightned, but dazled: Nor is there any place, or time,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4697,"wherein an Assemblie can receive Counsell with secrecie, because of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4698,their owne Multitude.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4699,"Thirdly, that the Resolutions of a Monarch, are subject to no other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4700,"Inconstancy, than that of Humane Nature; but in Assemblies, besides that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4701,"of Nature, there ariseth an Inconstancy from the Number. For the absence"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4702,"of a few, that would have the Resolution once taken, continue firme,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4703,"(which may happen by security, negligence, or private impediments,) or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4704,"the diligent appearance of a few of the contrary opinion, undoes to day,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4705,all that was concluded yesterday.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4706,"Fourthly, that a Monarch cannot disagree with himselfe, out of envy, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4707,"interest; but an Assembly may; and that to such a height, as may produce"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4708,a Civill Warre.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4709,"Fifthly, that in Monarchy there is this inconvenience; that any Subject,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4710,"by the power of one man, for the enriching of a favourite or flatterer,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4711,may be deprived of all he possesseth; which I confesse is a great and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4712,"inevitable inconvenience. But the same may as well happen, where the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4713,Soveraigne Power is in an Assembly: for their power is the same; and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4714,"they are as subject to evill Counsell, and to be seduced by Orators, as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4715,"a Monarch by Flatterers; and becoming one an others Flatterers, serve"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4716,one anothers Covetousnesse and Ambition by turnes. And whereas the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4717,"Favorites of an Assembly, are many; and the Kindred much more numerous,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4718,"than of any Monarch. Besides, there is no Favourite of a Monarch, which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4719,"cannot as well succour his friends, as hurt his enemies: But Orators,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4720,"that is to say, Favourites of Soveraigne Assemblies, though they have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4721,"great power to hurt, have little to save. For to accuse, requires lesse"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4722,"Eloquence (such is mans Nature) than to excuse; and condemnation, than"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4723,absolution more resembles Justice.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4724,"Sixtly, that it is an inconvenience in Monarchie, that the Soveraigntie"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4725,"may descend upon an Infant, or one that cannot discerne between Good and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4726,"Evill: and consisteth in this, that the use of his Power, must be in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4727,"hand of another Man, or of some Assembly of men, which are to governe by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4728,"his right, and in his name; as Curators, and Protectors of his Person,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4729,"and Authority. But to say there is inconvenience, in putting the use of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4730,"the Soveraign Power, into the hand of a Man, or an Assembly of men; is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4731,"to say that all Government is more Inconvenient, than Confusion, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4732,"Civill Warre. And therefore all the danger that can be pretended, must"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4733,"arise from the Contention of those, that for an office of so great"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4734,"honour, and profit, may become Competitors. To make it appear, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4735,"this inconvenience, proceedeth not from that forme of Government we call"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4736,"Monarchy, we are to consider, that the precedent Monarch, hath appointed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4737,"who shall have the Tuition of his Infant Successor, either expressely"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4738,"by Testament, or tacitly, by not controlling the Custome in that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4739,case received: And then such inconvenience (if it happen) is to be
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4740,"attributed, not to the Monarchy, but to the Ambition, and Injustice of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4741,"the Subjects; which in all kinds of Government, where the people are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4742,"not well instructed in their Duty, and the Rights of Soveraignty, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4743,"the same. Or else the precedent Monarch, hath not at all taken order for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4744,such Tuition; And then the Law of Nature hath provided this sufficient
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4745,"rule, That the Tuition shall be in him, that hath by Nature most"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4746,"interest in the preservation of the Authority of the Infant, and to whom"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4747,"least benefit can accrue by his death, or diminution. For seeing every"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4748,"man by nature seeketh his own benefit, and promotion; to put an Infant"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4749,"into the power of those, that can promote themselves by his destruction,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4750,"or dammage, is not Tuition, but Trechery. So that sufficient provision"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4751,"being taken, against all just quarrell, about the Government under a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4752,"Child, if any contention arise to the disturbance of the publique Peace,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4753,"it is not to be attributed to the forme of Monarchy, but to the ambition"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4754,"of Subjects, and ignorance of their Duty. On the other side, there is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4755,"no great Common-wealth, the Soveraignty whereof is in a great Assembly,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4756,"which is not, as to consultations of Peace, and Warre, and making of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4757,"Lawes, in the same condition, as if the Government were in a Child. For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4758,"as a Child wants the judgement to dissent from counsell given him, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4759,"is thereby necessitated to take the advise of them, or him, to whom he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4760,"is committed: So an Assembly wanteth the liberty, to dissent from the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4761,"counsell of the major part, be it good, or bad. And as a Child has need"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4762,"of a Tutor, or Protector, to preserve his Person, and Authority: So also"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4763,"(in great Common-wealths,) the Soveraign Assembly, in all great dangers"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4764,"and troubles, have need of Custodes Libertatis; that is of Dictators, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4765,Protectors of their Authoritie; which are as much as Temporary Monarchs;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4766,"to whom for a time, they may commit the entire exercise of their Power;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4767,"and have (at the end of that time) been oftner deprived thereof, than"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4768,"Infant Kings, by their Protectors, Regents, or any other Tutors."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4769,"Though the Kinds of Soveraigntie be, as I have now shewn, but three;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4770,"that is to say, Monarchie, where one Man has it; or Democracie, where"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4771,"the generall Assembly of Subjects hath it; or Aristocracie, where it is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4772,"in an Assembly of certain persons nominated, or otherwise distinguished"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4773,from the rest: Yet he that shall consider the particular Common-wealthes
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4774,"that have been, and are in the world, will not perhaps easily reduce"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4775,"them to three, and may thereby be inclined to think there be other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4776,"Formes, arising from these mingled together. As for example, Elective"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4777,Kingdomes; where Kings have the Soveraigne Power put into their hands
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4778,"for a time; of Kingdomes, wherein the King hath a power limited: which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4779,"Governments, are nevertheless by most Writers called Monarchie. Likewise"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4780,"if a Popular, or Aristocraticall Common-wealth, subdue an Enemies"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4781,"Countrie, and govern the same, by a President, Procurator, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4782,"other Magistrate; this may seeme perhaps at first sight, to be a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4783,"Democraticall, or Aristocraticall Government. But it is not so. For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4784,"Elective Kings, are not Soveraignes, but Ministers of the Soveraigne;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4785,"nor limited Kings Soveraignes, but Ministers of them that have the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4786,Soveraigne Power: nor are those Provinces which are in subjection to a
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4787,"Democracie, or Aristocracie of another Common-wealth, Democratically, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4788,"Aristocratically governed, but Monarchically."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4789,"And first, concerning an Elective King, whose power is limited to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4790,"his life, as it is in many places of Christendome at this day; or to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4791,"certaine Yeares or Moneths, as the Dictators power amongst the Romans;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4792,"If he have Right to appoint his Successor, he is no more Elective but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4793,"Hereditary. But if he have no Power to elect his Successor, then there"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4794,"is some other Man, or Assembly known, which after his decease may elect"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4795,"a new, or else the Common-wealth dieth, and dissolveth with him, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4796,returneth to the condition of Warre. If it be known who have the power
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4797,"to give the Soveraigntie after his death, it is known also that the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4798,Soveraigntie was in them before: For none have right to give that which
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4799,"they have not right to possesse, and keep to themselves, if they think"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4800,"good. But if there be none that can give the Soveraigntie, after the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4801,"decease of him that was first elected; then has he power, nay he is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4802,"obliged by the Law of Nature, to provide, by establishing his Successor,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4803,"to keep those that had trusted him with the Government, from relapsing"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4804,"into the miserable condition of Civill warre. And consequently he was,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4805,"when elected, a Soveraign absolute."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4806,"Secondly, that King whose power is limited, is not superiour to him, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4807,"them that have the power to limit it; and he that is not superiour, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4808,not supreme; that is to say not Soveraign. The Soveraignty therefore
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4809,was alwaies in that Assembly which had the Right to Limit him; and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4810,"by consequence the government not Monarchy, but either Democracy, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4811,Aristocracy; as of old time in Sparta; where the Kings had a priviledge
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4812,to lead their Armies; but the Soveraignty was in the Ephori.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4813,"Thirdly, whereas heretofore the Roman People, governed the land of Judea"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4814,(for example) by a President; yet was not Judea therefore a Democracy;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4815,"because they were not governed by any Assembly, into which, any of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4816,"them, had right to enter; nor by an Aristocracy; because they were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4817,"not governed by any Assembly, into which, any man could enter by their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4818,"Election: but they were governed by one Person, which though as to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4819,"people of Rome was an Assembly of the people, or Democracy; yet as to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4820,"the people of Judea, which had no right at all of participating in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4821,"government, was a Monarch. For though where the people are governed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4822,"by an Assembly, chosen by themselves out of their own number, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4823,"government is called a Democracy, or Aristocracy; yet when they are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4824,"governed by an Assembly, not of their own choosing, 'tis a Monarchy; not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4825,"of One man, over another man; but of one people, over another people."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4826,Of The Right Of Succession
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4827,"Of all these Formes of Government, the matter being mortall, so that not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4828,"onely Monarchs, but also whole Assemblies dy, it is necessary for the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4829,"conservation of the peace of men, that as there was order taken for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4830,"an Artificiall Man, so there be order also taken, for an Artificiall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4831,"Eternity of life; without which, men that are governed by an Assembly,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4832,should return into the condition of Warre in every age; and they
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4833,"that are governed by One man, as soon as their Governour dyeth. This"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4834,"Artificiall Eternity, is that which men call the Right of Succession."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4835,"There is no perfect forme of Government, where the disposing of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4836,Succession is not in the present Soveraign. For if it be in any other
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4837,"particular Man, or private Assembly, it is in a person subject, and may"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4838,be assumed by the Soveraign at his pleasure; and consequently the Right
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4839,"is in himselfe. And if it be in no particular man, but left to a new"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4840,choyce; then is the Common-wealth dissolved; and the Right is in him
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4841,that can get it; contrary to the intention of them that did institute
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4842,"the Common-wealth, for their perpetuall, and not temporary security."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4843,"In a Democracy, the whole Assembly cannot faile, unlesse the Multitude"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4844,that are to be governed faile. And therefore questions of the right of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4845,"Succession, have in that forme of Government no place at all."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4846,"In an Aristocracy, when any of the Assembly dyeth, the election of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4847,"another into his room belongeth to the Assembly, as the Soveraign, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4848,"whom belongeth the choosing of all Counsellours, and Officers. For that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4849,"which the Representative doth, as Actor, every one of the Subjects doth,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4850,"as Author. And though the Soveraign assembly, may give Power to others,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4851,"to elect new men, for supply of their Court; yet it is still by their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4852,"Authority, that the Election is made; and by the same it may (when the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4853,publique shall require it) be recalled.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4854,The Present Monarch Hath Right To Dispose Of The Succession The greatest
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4855,"difficultie about the right of Succession, is in Monarchy: And the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4856,"difficulty ariseth from this, that at first sight, it is not manifest"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4857,"who is to appoint the Successor; nor many times, who it is whom he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4858,"hath appointed. For in both these cases, there is required a more exact"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4859,"ratiocination, than every man is accustomed to use. As to the question,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4860,"who shall appoint the Successor, of a Monarch that hath the Soveraign"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4861,"Authority; that is to say, (for Elective Kings and Princes have not the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4862,"Soveraign Power in propriety, but in use only,) we are to consider, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4863,"either he that is in possession, has right to dispose of the Succession,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4864,or else that right is again in the dissolved Multitude. For the death
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4865,"of him that hath the Soveraign power in propriety, leaves the Multitude"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4866,"without any Soveraign at all; that is, without any Representative in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4867,"whom they should be united, and be capable of doing any one action at"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4868,all: And therefore they are incapable of Election of any new Monarch;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4869,every man having equall right to submit himselfe to such as he thinks
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4870,"best able to protect him, or if he can, protect himselfe by his owne"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4871,"sword; which is a returne to Confusion, and to the condition of a War of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4872,"every man against every man, contrary to the end for which Monarchy had"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4873,"its first Institution. Therfore it is manifest, that by the Institution"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4874,"of Monarchy, the disposing of the Successor, is alwaies left to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4875,Judgment and Will of the present Possessor.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4876,And for the question (which may arise sometimes) who it is that the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4877,"Monarch in possession, hath designed to the succession and inheritance"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4878,"of his power; it is determined by his expresse Words, and Testament; or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4879,by other tacite signes sufficient.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4880,Succession Passeth By Expresse Words;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4881,"By expresse Words, or Testament, when it is declared by him in his life"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4882,"time, viva voce, or by Writing; as the first Emperours of Rome declared"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4883,who should be their Heires. For the word Heire does not of it selfe
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4884,"imply the Children, or nearest Kindred of a man; but whomsoever a man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4885,"shall any way declare, he would have to succeed him in his Estate."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4886,"If therefore a Monarch declare expresly, that such a man shall be his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4887,"Heire, either by Word or Writing, then is that man immediately after the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4888,"decease of his Predecessor, Invested in the right of being Monarch."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4889,"Or, By Not Controlling A Custome;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4890,"But where Testament, and expresse Words are wanting, other naturall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4891,signes of the Will are to be followed: whereof the one is Custome. And
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4892,"therefore where the Custome is, that the next of Kindred absolutely"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4893,"succeedeth, there also the next of Kindred hath right to the Succession;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4894,"for that, if the will of him that was in posession had been otherwise,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4895,he might easily have declared the same in his life time. And likewise
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4896,"where the Custome is, that the next of the Male Kindred succeedeth,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4897,"there also the right of Succession is in the next of the Kindred Male,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4898,for the same reason. And so it is if the Custome were to advance the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4899,"Female. For whatsoever Custome a man may by a word controule, and does"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4900,"not, it is a naturall signe he would have that Custome stand."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4901,"Or, By Presumption Of Naturall Affection"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4902,"But where neither Custome, nor Testament hath preceded, there it is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4903,"to be understood, First, that a Monarchs will is, that the government"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4904,remain Monarchicall; because he hath approved that government in
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4905,"himselfe. Secondly, that a Child of his own, Male, or Female, be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4906,preferred before any other; because men are presumed to be more enclined
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4907,"by nature, to advance their own children, than the children of other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4908,"men; and of their own, rather a Male than a Female; because men, are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4909,"naturally fitter than women, for actions of labour and danger. Thirdly,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4910,"where his own Issue faileth, rather a Brother than a stranger; and so"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4911,"still the neerer in bloud, rather than the more remote, because it is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4912,"alwayes presumed that the neerer of kin, is the neerer in affection; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4913,"'tis evident that a man receives alwayes, by reflexion, the most honour"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4914,from the greatnesse of his neerest kindred.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4915,"To Dispose Of The Succession, Though To A King Of Another Nation,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4916,Not Unlawfull
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4917,But if it be lawfull for a Monarch to dispose of the Succession by words
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4918,"of Contract, or Testament, men may perhaps object a great inconvenience:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4919,"for he may sell, or give his Right of governing to a stranger; which,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4920,"because strangers (that is, men not used to live under the same"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4921,"government, not speaking the same language) do commonly undervalue one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4922,"another, may turn to the oppression of his Subjects; which is indeed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4923,a great inconvenience; but it proceedeth not necessarily from the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4924,"subjection to a strangers government, but from the unskilfulnesse of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4925,"Governours, ignorant of the true rules of Politiques. And therefore"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4926,"the Romans when they had subdued many Nations, to make their Government"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4927,"digestible, were wont to take away that grievance, as much as they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4928,"thought necessary, by giving sometimes to whole Nations, and sometimes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4929,"to Principall men of every Nation they conquered, not onely the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4930,"Privileges, but also the Name of Romans; and took many of them into the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4931,"Senate, and Offices of charge, even in the Roman City. And this was it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4932,"our most wise King, King James, aymed at, in endeavouring the Union of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4933,"his two Realms of England and Scotland. Which if he could have obtained,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4934,"had in all likelihood prevented the Civill warres, which make both those"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4935,"Kingdomes at this present, miserable. It is not therefore any injury to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4936,"the people, for a Monarch to dispose of the Succession by Will; though"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4937,"by the fault of many Princes, it hath been sometimes found inconvenient."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4938,"Of the lawfulnesse of it, this also is an argument, that whatsoever"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4939,"inconvenience can arrive by giving a Kingdome to a stranger, may arrive"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4940,"also by so marrying with strangers, as the Right of Succession may"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,19,4941,descend upon them: yet this by all men is accounted lawfull.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4942,CHAPTER XX. OF DOMINION PATERNALL AND DESPOTICALL
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4943,"A Common-wealth by Acquisition, is that, where the Soveraign Power is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4944,"acquired by Force; And it is acquired by force, when men singly, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4945,"many together by plurality of voyces, for fear of death, or bonds, do"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4946,"authorise all the actions of that Man, or Assembly, that hath their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4947,lives and liberty in his Power.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4948,Wherein Different From A Common-wealth By Institution
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4949,"And this kind of Dominion, or Soveraignty, differeth from Soveraignty by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4950,"Institution, onely in this, That men who choose their Soveraign, do it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4951,"for fear of one another, and not of him whom they Institute: But in this"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4952,"case, they subject themselves, to him they are afraid of. In both cases"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4953,"they do it for fear: which is to be noted by them, that hold all such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4954,"Covenants, as proceed from fear of death, or violence, voyd: which if"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4955,"it were true, no man, in any kind of Common-wealth, could be obliged"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4956,"to Obedience. It is true, that in a Common-wealth once Instituted, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4957,"acquired, Promises proceeding from fear of death, or violence, are no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4958,"Covenants, nor obliging, when the thing promised is contrary to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4959,"Lawes; But the reason is not, because it was made upon fear, but because"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4960,"he that promiseth, hath no right in the thing promised. Also, when he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4961,"may lawfully performe, and doth not, it is not the Invalidity of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4962,"the Covenant, that absolveth him, but the Sentence of the Soveraign."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4963,"Otherwise, whensoever a man lawfully promiseth, he unlawfully breaketh:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4964,"But when the Soveraign, who is the Actor, acquitteth him, then he is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4965,"acquitted by him that exorted the promise, as by the Author of such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4966,absolution.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4967,The Rights Of Soveraignty The Same In Both
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4968,"But the Rights, and Consequences of Soveraignty, are the same in both."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4969,"His Power cannot, without his consent, be Transferred to another: He"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4970,"cannot Forfeit it: He cannot be Accused by any of his Subjects, of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4971,Injury: He cannot be Punished by them: He is Judge of what is necessary
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4972,for Peace; and Judge of Doctrines: He is Sole Legislator; and Supreme
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4973,"Judge of Controversies; and of the Times, and Occasions of Warre,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4974,"and Peace: to him it belongeth to choose Magistrates, Counsellours,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4975,"Commanders, and all other Officers, and Ministers; and to determine of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4976,"Rewards, and punishments, Honour, and Order. The reasons whereof, are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4977,"the same which are alledged in the precedent Chapter, for the same"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4978,"Rights, and Consequences of Soveraignty by Institution."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4979,"Dominion Paternall How Attained Not By Generation, But By Contract"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4980,"Dominion is acquired two wayes; By Generation, and by Conquest. The"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4981,"right of Dominion by Generation, is that, which the Parent hath over"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4982,his Children; and is called PATERNALL. And is not so derived from the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4983,"Generation, as if therefore the Parent had Dominion over his Child"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4984,"because he begat him; but from the Childs Consent, either expresse, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4985,"by other sufficient arguments declared. For as to the Generation, God"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4986,hath ordained to man a helper; and there be alwayes two that are equally
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4987,"Parents: the Dominion therefore over the Child, should belong equally to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4988,"both; and he be equally subject to both, which is impossible; for no man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4989,can obey two Masters. And whereas some have attributed the Dominion to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4990,"the Man onely, as being of the more excellent Sex; they misreckon in it."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4991,For there is not always that difference of strength or prudence between
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4992,"the man and the woman, as that the right can be determined without War."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4993,"In Common-wealths, this controversie is decided by the Civill Law: and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4994,"for the most part, (but not alwayes) the sentence is in favour of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4995,Father; because for the most part Common-wealths have been erected by
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4996,"the Fathers, not by the Mothers of families. But the question lyeth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4997,now in the state of meer Nature; where there are supposed no lawes
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4998,of Matrimony; no lawes for the Education of Children; but the Law of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,4999,"Nature, and the naturall inclination of the Sexes, one to another, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5000,"to their children. In this condition of meer Nature, either the Parents"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5001,between themselves dispose of the dominion over the Child by Contract;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5002,"or do not dispose thereof at all. If they dispose thereof, the right"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5003,passeth according to the Contract. We find in History that the Amazons
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5004,"Contracted with the Men of the neighbouring Countries, to whom they had"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5005,"recourse for issue, that the issue Male should be sent back, but the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5006,Female remain with themselves: so that the dominion of the Females was
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5007,in the Mother.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5008,Or Education;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5009,"If there be no Contract, the Dominion is in the Mother. For in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5010,"condition of Meer Nature, where there are no Matrimoniall lawes, it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5011,"cannot be known who is the Father, unlesse it be declared by the Mother:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5012,and therefore the right of Dominion over the Child dependeth on her
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5013,"will, and is consequently hers. Again, seeing the Infant is first in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5014,"power of the Mother; so as she may either nourish, or expose it, if she"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5015,"nourish it, it oweth its life to the Mother; and is therefore obliged to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5016,"obey her, rather than any other; and by consequence the Dominion over"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5017,"it is hers. But if she expose it, and another find, and nourish it, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5018,Dominion is in him that nourisheth it. For it ought to obey him by whom
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5019,"it is preserved; because preservation of life being the end, for which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5020,"one man becomes subject to another, every man is supposed to promise"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5021,"obedience, to him, in whose power it is to save, or destroy him."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5022,Or Precedent Subjection Of One Of The Parents To The Other
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5023,"If the Mother be the Fathers subject, the Child, is in the Fathers"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5024,"power: and if the Father be the Mothers subject, (as when a Soveraign"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5025,"Queen marrieth one of her subjects,) the Child is subject to the Mother;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5026,because the Father also is her subject.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5027,"If a man and a woman, Monarches of two severall Kingdomes, have a Child,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5028,"and contract concerning who shall have the Dominion of him, the Right of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5029,"the Dominion passeth by the Contract. If they contract not, the Dominion"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5030,followeth the Dominion of the place of his residence. For the Soveraign
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5031,of each Country hath Dominion over all that reside therein.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5032,"He that hath the Dominion over the Child, hath Dominion also over their"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5080,"of owning, and authorising whatsoever the Master shall do. And in case"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5083,and cannot accuse him of injury.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5084,In summe the Rights and Consequences of both Paternall and Despoticall
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5085,"Dominion, are the very same with those of a Soveraign by Institution;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5086,and for the same reasons: which reasons are set down in the precedent
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5087,"chapter. So that for a man that is Monarch of divers Nations, whereof he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5088,"hath, in one the Soveraignty by Institution of the people assembled, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5089,"in another by Conquest, that is by the Submission of each particular,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5090,"to avoyd death or bonds; to demand of one Nation more than of the other,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5091,"from the title of Conquest, as being a Conquered Nation, is an act of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5092,ignorance of the Rights of Soveraignty. For the Soveraign is absolute
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5093,over both alike; or else there is no Soveraignty at all; and so every
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5094,"man may Lawfully protect himselfe, if he can, with his own sword, which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5095,is the condition of war.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5096,Difference Between A Family And A Kingdom
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5097,"By this it appears, that a great Family if it be not part of some"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5098,"Common-wealth, is of it self, as to the Rights of Soveraignty, a little"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5099,Monarchy; whether that Family consist of a man and his children; or of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5100,"a man and his servants; or of a man, and his children, and servants"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5101,together: wherein the Father of Master is the Soveraign. But yet a
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5102,Family is not properly a Common-wealth; unlesse it be of that power by
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5103,"its own number, or by other opportunities, as not to be subdued without"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5104,the hazard of war. For where a number of men are manifestly too weak to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5105,"defend themselves united, every one may use his own reason in time of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5106,"danger, to save his own life, either by flight, or by submission to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5107,"the enemy, as hee shall think best; in the same manner as a very small"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5108,"company of souldiers, surprised by an army, may cast down their armes,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5109,"and demand quarter, or run away, rather than be put to the sword. And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5110,"thus much shall suffice; concerning what I find by speculation, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5111,"deduction, of Soveraign Rights, from the nature, need, and designes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5112,"of men, in erecting of Commonwealths, and putting themselves under"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5115,The Right Of Monarchy From Scripture
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5116,Let us now consider what the Scripture teacheth in the same point. To
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5117,"Moses, the children of Israel say thus. (Exod. 20. 19) ""Speak thou to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5118,"us, and we will heare thee; but let not God speak to us, lest we dye."""
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5119,"This is absolute obedience to Moses. Concerning the Right of Kings, God"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5120,"himself by the mouth of Samuel, saith, (1 Sam. 8. 11, 12, &c.) ""This"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5121,shall be the Right of the King you will have to reigne over you. He
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5122,"shall take your sons, and set them to drive his Chariots, and to be his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5123,"horsemen, and to run before his chariots; and gather in his harvest; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5124,"to make his engines of War, and Instruments of his chariots; and shall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5125,"take your daughters to make perfumes, to be his Cookes, and Bakers. He"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5126,"shall take your fields, your vine-yards, and your olive-yards, and give"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5127,"them to his servants. He shall take the tyth of your corne and wine, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5128,"give it to the men of his chamber, and to his other servants. He shall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5129,"take your man-servants, and your maid-servants, and the choice of your"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5130,"youth, and employ them in his businesse. He shall take the tyth of your"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5131,"flocks; and you shall be his servants."" This is absolute power, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5132,"summed up in the last words, ""you shall be his servants."" Againe, when"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5133,"the people heard what power their King was to have, yet they consented"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5134,"thereto, and say thus, (Verse. 19 &c.) ""We will be as all other nations,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5135,"and our King shall judge our causes, and goe before us, to conduct our"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5136,"wars."" Here is confirmed the Right that Soveraigns have, both to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5137,"Militia, and to all Judicature; in which is conteined as absolute power,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5138,"as one man can possibly transferre to another. Again, the prayer of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5139,"King Salomon to God, was this. (1 Kings 3. 9) ""Give to thy servant"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5140,"understanding, to judge thy people, and to discerne between Good and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5141,"Evill."" It belongeth therefore to the Soveraigne to bee Judge, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5142,to praescribe the Rules of Discerning Good and Evill; which Rules are
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5143,Lawes; and therefore in him is the Legislative Power. Saul sought
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5144,"the life of David; yet when it was in his power to slay Saul, and his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5145,"Servants would have done it, David forbad them, saying (1 Sam. 24. 9)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5146,"""God forbid I should do such an act against my Lord, the anoynted of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5147,"God."" For obedience of servants St. Paul saith, (Coll. 3. 20) ""Servants"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5149,"Parents in All things."" There is simple obedience in those that are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5150,"subject to Paternall, or Despoticall Dominion. Again, (Math. 23. 2,3)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5151,"""The Scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses chayre and therefore All that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5152,"they shall bid you observe, that observe and do."" There again is simple"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5154,"themselves to Princes, and to those that are in Authority, & obey"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5155,"them."" This obedience is also simple. Lastly, our Saviour himselfe"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5156,"acknowledges, that men ought to pay such taxes as are by Kings imposed,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5157,"where he sayes, ""Give to Caesar that which is Caesars;"" and payed such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5158,"taxes himselfe. And that the Kings word, is sufficient to take any thing"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5159,"from any subject, when there is need; and that the King is Judge of that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5160,"need: For he himselfe, as King of the Jewes, commanded his Disciples to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5161,"take the Asse, and Asses Colt to carry him into Jerusalem, saying, (Mat."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5162,"21. 2,3) ""Go into the Village over against you, and you shall find a"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5166,necessity be a sufficient title; nor whether he be judge of that
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5167,necessity; but acquiesce in the will of the Lord.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5168,"To these places may be added also that of Genesis, (Gen. 3. 5) ""You"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5181,"meaning is plain, that it was then they first judged their nakednesse"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5182,(wherein it was Gods will to create them) to be uncomely; and by being

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5189,Soveraign Power Ought In All Common-wealths To Be Absolute
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5190,"So it appeareth plainly, to my understanding, both from Reason, and"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5208,"Subjects never did dispute of the Soveraign Power. But howsoever, an"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5209,"argument for the Practise of men, that have not sifted to the bottom,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5210,"and with exact reason weighed the causes, and nature of Common-wealths,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5211,"and suffer daily those miseries, that proceed from the ignorance"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5212,"thereof, is invalid. For though in all places of the world, men should"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5213,"lay the foundation of their houses on the sand, it could not thence be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5214,"inferred, that so it ought to be. The skill of making, and maintaining"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,20,5215,"Common-wealths, consisteth in certain Rules, as doth Arithmetique and"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5219,CHAPTER XXI. OF THE LIBERTY OF SUBJECTS
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5220,Liberty What
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5221,"Liberty, or FREEDOME, signifieth (properly) the absence of Opposition;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5222,"(by Opposition, I mean externall Impediments of motion;) and may"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5223,"be applyed no lesse to Irrational, and Inanimate creatures, than to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5224,"Rationall. For whatsoever is so tyed, or environed, as it cannot move,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5225,"but within a certain space, which space is determined by the opposition"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5226,"of some externall body, we say it hath not Liberty to go further. And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5227,"so of all living creatures, whilest they are imprisoned, or restrained,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5228,"with walls, or chayns; and of the water whilest it is kept in by banks,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5229,"or vessels, that otherwise would spread it selfe into a larger space, we"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5230,"use to say, they are not at Liberty, to move in such manner, as without"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5231,those externall impediments they would. But when the impediment of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5232,"motion, is in the constitution of the thing it selfe, we use not to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5233,"say, it wants the Liberty; but the Power to move; as when a stone lyeth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5234,"still, or a man is fastned to his bed by sicknesse."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5235,What It Is To Be Free
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5236,"And according to this proper, and generally received meaning of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5237,"word, A FREE-MAN, is ""he, that in those things, which by his strength"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5238,"and wit he is able to do, is not hindred to doe what he has a will"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5239,"to."" But when the words Free, and Liberty, are applyed to any thing but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5240,"Bodies, they are abused; for that which is not subject to Motion, is not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5241,"subject to Impediment: And therefore, when 'tis said (for example) The"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5242,"way is free, no liberty of the way is signified, but of those that walk"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5243,"in it without stop. And when we say a Guift is free, there is not meant"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5244,"any liberty of the Guift, but of the Giver, that was not bound by any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5245,"law, or Covenant to give it. So when we Speak Freely, it is not the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5246,"liberty of voice, or pronunciation, but of the man, whom no law hath"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5247,"obliged to speak otherwise then he did. Lastly, from the use of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5248,"word Freewill, no liberty can be inferred to the will, desire, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5249,"inclination, but the liberty of the man; which consisteth in this, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5250,"he finds no stop, in doing what he has the will, desire, or inclination"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5251,to doe.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5252,Feare And Liberty Consistent
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5253,Feare and Liberty are consistent; as when a man throweth his goods into
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5254,"the Sea for Feare the ship should sink, he doth it neverthelesse very"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5255,"willingly, and may refuse to doe it if he will: It is therefore the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5256,"action, of one that was Free; so a man sometimes pays his debt, only for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5257,"Feare of Imprisonment, which because no body hindred him from detaining,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5258,was the action of a man at Liberty. And generally all actions which men
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5259,"doe in Common-wealths, for Feare of the law, or actions, which the doers"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5260,had Liberty to omit.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5261,Liberty And Necessity Consistent
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5262,"Liberty and Necessity are Consistent: As in the water, that hath not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5263,"only Liberty, but a Necessity of descending by the Channel: so likewise"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5264,in the Actions which men voluntarily doe; which (because they proceed
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5265,from their will) proceed from Liberty; and yet because every act of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5266,"mans will, and every desire, and inclination proceedeth from some cause,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5267,which causes in a continuall chaine (whose first link in the hand of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5268,God the first of all causes) proceed from Necessity. So that to him
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5269,"that could see the connexion of those causes, the Necessity of all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5270,"mens voluntary actions, would appeare manifest. And therefore God, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5271,"seeth, and disposeth all things, seeth also that the Liberty of man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5272,"in doing what he will, is accompanied with the Necessity of doing that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5273,"which God will, & no more, nor lesse. For though men may do many things,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5274,"which God does not command, nor is therefore Author of them; yet they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5275,"can have no passion, nor appetite to any thing, of which appetite Gods"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5276,will is not the cause. And did not his will assure the Necessity of mans
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5277,"will, and consequently of all that on mans will dependeth, the Liberty"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5278,"of men would be a contradiction, and impediment to the omnipotence and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5279,"Liberty of God. And this shall suffice, (as to the matter in hand) of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5280,"that naturall Liberty, which only is properly called Liberty."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5281,"Artificiall Bonds, Or Covenants"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5282,"But as men, for the atteyning of peace, and conservation of themselves"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5283,"thereby, have made an Artificiall Man, which we call a Common-wealth; so"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5284,"also have they made Artificiall Chains, called Civill Lawes, which they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5285,"themselves, by mutuall covenants, have fastned at one end, to the lips"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5286,"of that Man, or Assembly, to whom they have given the Soveraigne Power;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5287,and at the other end to their own Ears. These Bonds in their own nature
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5288,"but weak, may neverthelesse be made to hold, by the danger, though not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5289,by the difficulty of breaking them.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5290,Liberty Of Subjects Consisteth In Liberty From Covenants
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5291,"In relation to these Bonds only it is, that I am to speak now, of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5292,"Liberty of Subjects. For seeing there is no Common-wealth in the world,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5293,"for the regulating of all the actions, and words of men, (as being"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5294,"a thing impossible:) it followeth necessarily, that in all kinds of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5295,"actions, by the laws praetermitted, men have the Liberty, of doing what"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5296,"their own reasons shall suggest, for the most profitable to themselves."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5297,"For if wee take Liberty in the proper sense, for corporall Liberty; that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5298,"is to say, freedome from chains, and prison, it were very absurd for men"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5299,"to clamor as they doe, for the Liberty they so manifestly enjoy. Againe,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5300,"if we take Liberty, for an exemption from Lawes, it is no lesse absurd,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5301,"for men to demand as they doe, that Liberty, by which all other men may"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5302,"be masters of their lives. And yet as absurd as it is, this is it they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5303,"demand; not knowing that the Lawes are of no power to protect them,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5304,"without a Sword in the hands of a man, or men, to cause those laws to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5305,"be put in execution. The Liberty of a Subject, lyeth therefore only"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5306,"in those things, which in regulating their actions, the Soveraign hath"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5307,"praetermitted; such as is the Liberty to buy, and sell, and otherwise"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5308,"contract with one another; to choose their own aboad, their own diet,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5309,"their own trade of life, and institute their children as they themselves"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5310,think fit; & the like.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5311,Liberty Of The Subject Consistent With Unlimited Power Of The Soveraign
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5312,"Neverthelesse we are not to understand, that by such Liberty, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5313,"Soveraign Power of life, and death, is either abolished, or limited. For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5314,"it has been already shewn, that nothing the Soveraign Representative"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5315,"can doe to a Subject, on what pretence soever, can properly be called"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5316,"Injustice, or Injury; because every Subject is Author of every act the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5317,"Soveraign doth; so that he never wanteth Right to any thing, otherwise,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5318,"than as he himself is the Subject of God, and bound thereby to observe"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5319,"the laws of Nature. And therefore it may, and doth often happen in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5320,"Common-wealths, that a Subject may be put to death, by the command of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5321,the Soveraign Power; and yet neither doe the other wrong: as when Jeptha
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5322,"caused his daughter to be sacrificed: In which, and the like cases,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5323,"he that so dieth, had Liberty to doe the action, for which he is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5324,"neverthelesse, without Injury put to death. And the same holdeth also"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5325,"in a Soveraign Prince, that putteth to death an Innocent Subject. For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5326,"though the action be against the law of Nature, as being contrary to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5327,"Equitie, (as was the killing of Uriah, by David;) yet it was not an"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5328,"Injurie to Uriah; but to God. Not to Uriah, because the right to doe"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5329,"what he pleased, was given him by Uriah himself; And yet to God, because"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5330,David was Gods Subject; and prohibited all Iniquitie by the law of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5331,"Nature. Which distinction, David himself, when he repented the fact,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5332,"evidently confirmed, saying, ""To thee only have I sinned."" In the same"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5333,"manner, the people of Athens, when they banished the most potent of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5334,"their Common-wealth for ten years, thought they committed no Injustice;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5335,and yet they never questioned what crime he had done; but what hurt he
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5336,would doe: Nay they commanded the banishment of they knew not whom; and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5337,"every Citizen bringing his Oystershell into the market place, written"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5338,"with the name of him he desired should be banished, without actuall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5339,"accusing him, sometimes banished an Aristides, for his reputation of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5340,"Justice; And sometimes a scurrilous Jester, as Hyperbolus, to make a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5341,"Jest of it. And yet a man cannot say, the Soveraign People of Athens"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5342,"wanted right to banish them; or an Athenian the Libertie to Jest, or to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5343,be Just.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5344,"The Liberty Which Writers Praise, Is The Liberty Of Soveraigns;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5345,Not Of Private Men
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5346,"The Libertie, whereof there is so frequent, and honourable mention, in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5347,"the Histories, and Philosophy of the Antient Greeks, and Romans, and in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5348,"the writings, and discourse of those that from them have received all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5349,"their learning in the Politiques, is not the Libertie of Particular"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5350,men; but the Libertie of the Common-wealth: which is the same with
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5351,"that, which every man then should have, if there were no Civil Laws,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5352,nor Common-wealth at all. And the effects of it also be the same. For as
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5353,"amongst masterlesse men, there is perpetuall war, of every man against"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5354,"his neighbour; no inheritance, to transmit to the Son, nor to expect"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5355,"from the Father; no propriety of Goods, or Lands; no security; but a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5356,"full and absolute Libertie in every Particular man: So in States, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5357,"Common-wealths not dependent on one another, every Common-wealth, (not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5358,"every man) has an absolute Libertie, to doe what it shall judge (that is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5359,"to say, what that Man, or Assemblie that representeth it, shall judge)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5360,"most conducing to their benefit. But withall, they live in the condition"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5361,"of a perpetuall war, and upon the confines of battel, with their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5362,"frontiers armed, and canons planted against their neighbours"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5363,"round about. The Athenians, and Romanes, were free; that is, free"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5364,Common-wealths: not that any particular men had the Libertie to resist
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5365,their own Representative; but that their Representative had the Libertie
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5366,"to resist, or invade other people. There is written on the Turrets of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5367,"the city of Luca in great characters at this day, the word LIBERTAS; yet"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5368,"no man can thence inferre, that a particular man has more Libertie,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5369,"or Immunitie from the service of the Commonwealth there, than in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5370,"Constantinople. Whether a Common-wealth be Monarchicall, or Popular, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5371,Freedome is still the same.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5372,"But it is an easy thing, for men to be deceived, by the specious name"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5373,"of Libertie; and for want of Judgement to distinguish, mistake that for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5374,"their Private Inheritance, and Birth right, which is the right of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5375,Publique only. And when the same errour is confirmed by the authority of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5376,"men in reputation for their writings in this subject, it is no wonder if"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5377,"it produce sedition, and change of Government. In these westerne"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5378,"parts of the world, we are made to receive our opinions concerning the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5379,"Institution, and Rights of Common-wealths, from Aristotle, Cicero, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5380,"other men, Greeks and Romanes, that living under Popular States, derived"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5381,"those Rights, not from the Principles of Nature, but transcribed them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5382,"into their books, out of the Practice of their own Common-wealths, which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5383,"were Popular; as the Grammarians describe the Rules of Language, out of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5384,"the Practise of the time; or the Rules of Poetry, out of the Poems of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5385,"Homer and Virgil. And because the Athenians were taught, (to keep them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5386,"from desire of changing their Government,) that they were Freemen, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5387,all that lived under Monarchy were slaves; therefore Aristotle puts it
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5388,"down in his Politiques,(lib.6.cap.2) ""In democracy, Liberty is to be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5389,"supposed: for 'tis commonly held, that no man is Free in any other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5390,"Government."" And as Aristotle; so Cicero, and other Writers have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5391,"grounded their Civill doctrine, on the opinions of the Romans, who were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5392,"taught to hate Monarchy, at first, by them that having deposed their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5393,"Soveraign, shared amongst them the Soveraignty of Rome; and afterwards"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5394,"by their Successors. And by reading of these Greek, and Latine Authors,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5395,men from their childhood have gotten a habit (under a false shew of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5396,"Liberty,) of favouring tumults, and of licentious controlling the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5397,"actions of their Soveraigns; and again of controlling those controllers,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5398,"with the effusion of so much blood; as I think I may truly say, there"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5399,"was never any thing so deerly bought, as these Western parts have bought"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5400,the learning of the Greek and Latine tongues.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5401,Liberty Of The Subject How To Be Measured
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5402,To come now to the particulars of the true Liberty of a Subject; that is
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5403,"to say, what are the things, which though commanded by the Soveraign, he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5404,"may neverthelesse, without Injustice, refuse to do; we are to consider,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5405,"what Rights we passe away, when we make a Common-wealth; or (which is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5406,"all one,) what Liberty we deny our selves, by owning all the Actions"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5407,"(without exception) of the Man, or Assembly we make our Soveraign. For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5408,"in the act of our Submission, consisteth both our Obligation, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5409,our Liberty; which must therefore be inferred by arguments taken from
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5410,"thence; there being no Obligation on any man, which ariseth not from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5411,"some Act of his own; for all men equally, are by Nature Free. And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5412,"because such arguments, must either be drawn from the expresse words, ""I"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5413,"Authorise all his Actions,"" or from the Intention of him that submitteth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5414,"himselfe to his Power, (which Intention is to be understood by the End"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5415,"for which he so submitteth;) The Obligation, and Liberty of the Subject,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5416,"is to be derived, either from those Words, (or others equivalent;) or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5417,"else from the End of the Institution of Soveraignty; namely, the Peace"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5418,"of the Subjects within themselves, and their Defence against a common"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5419,Enemy.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5420,"Subjects Have Liberty To Defend Their Own Bodies,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5421,Even Against Them That Lawfully Invade Them
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5422,"First therefore, seeing Soveraignty by Institution, is by Covenant of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5423,"every one to every one; and Soveraignty by Acquisition, by Covenants of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5424,"the Vanquished to the Victor, or Child to the Parent; It is manifest,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5425,"that every Subject has Liberty in all those things, the right whereof"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5426,cannot by Covenant be transferred. I have shewn before in the 14.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5427,"Chapter, that Covenants, not to defend a mans own body, are voyd."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5428,"Therefore,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5429,Are Not Bound To Hurt Themselves;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5430,"If the Soveraign command a man (though justly condemned,) to kill,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5431,"wound, or mayme himselfe; or not to resist those that assault him; or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5432,"to abstain from the use of food, ayre, medicine, or any other thing,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5433,without which he cannot live; yet hath that man the Liberty to disobey.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5434,"If a man be interrogated by the Soveraign, or his Authority, concerning"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5435,"a crime done by himselfe, he is not bound (without assurance of Pardon)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5436,to confesse it; because no man (as I have shewn in the same Chapter) can
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5437,be obliged by Covenant to accuse himselfe.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5438,"Again, the Consent of a Subject to Soveraign Power, is contained in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5439,"these words, ""I Authorise, or take upon me, all his actions;"" in which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5440,"there is no restriction at all, of his own former naturall Liberty:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5441,"For by allowing him to Kill Me, I am not bound to Kill my selfe when"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5442,"he commands me. ""'Tis one thing to say 'Kill me, or my fellow, if you"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5443,"please;' another thing to say, 'I will kill my selfe, or my fellow.'"" It"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5444,"followeth therefore, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5445,"No man is bound by the words themselves, either to kill himselfe, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5446,"any other man; And consequently, that the Obligation a man may sometimes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5447,"have, upon the Command of the Soveraign to execute any dangerous, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5448,"dishonourable Office, dependeth not on the Words of our Submission; but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5449,on the Intention; which is to be understood by the End thereof. When
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5450,"therefore our refusall to obey, frustrates the End for which the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5451,Soveraignty was ordained; then there is no Liberty to refuse: otherwise
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5452,there is.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5453,"Nor To Warfare, Unless They Voluntarily Undertake It"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5454,"Upon this ground, a man that is commanded as a Souldier to fight against"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5455,"the enemy, though his Soveraign have Right enough to punish his refusall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5456,"with death, may neverthelesse in many cases refuse, without Injustice;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5457,as when he substituteth a sufficient Souldier in his place: for in this
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5458,case he deserteth not the service of the Common-wealth. And there is
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5459,"allowance to be made for naturall timorousnesse, not onely to women, (of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5460,"whom no such dangerous duty is expected,) but also to men of feminine"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5461,"courage. When Armies fight, there is on one side, or both, a running"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5462,"away; yet when they do it not out of trechery, but fear, they are not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5463,"esteemed to do it unjustly, but dishonourably. For the same reason, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5464,"avoyd battell, is not Injustice, but Cowardise. But he that inrowleth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5465,"himselfe a Souldier, or taketh imprest mony, taketh away the excuse of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5466,"a timorous nature; and is obliged, not onely to go to the battell,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5467,"but also not to run from it, without his Captaines leave. And when the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5468,"Defence of the Common-wealth, requireth at once the help of all that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5469,"are able to bear Arms, every one is obliged; because otherwise the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5470,"Institution of the Common-wealth, which they have not the purpose, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5471,"courage to preserve, was in vain."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5472,"To resist the Sword of the Common-wealth, in defence of another man,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5473,"guilty, or innocent, no man hath Liberty; because such Liberty, takes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5474,"away from the Soveraign, the means of Protecting us; and is therefore"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5475,destructive of the very essence of Government. But in case a great many
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5476,"men together, have already resisted the Soveraign Power Unjustly, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5477,"committed some Capitall crime, for which every one of them expecteth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5478,"death, whether have they not the Liberty then to joyn together, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5479,"assist, and defend one another? Certainly they have: For they but defend"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5480,"their lives, which the guilty man may as well do, as the Innocent. There"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5481,was indeed injustice in the first breach of their duty; Their bearing of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5482,"Arms subsequent to it, though it be to maintain what they have done, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5483,"no new unjust act. And if it be onely to defend their persons, it is not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5484,"unjust at all. But the offer of Pardon taketh from them, to whom it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5485,"is offered, the plea of self-defence, and maketh their perseverance in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5486,"assisting, or defending the rest, unlawfull."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5487,"The Greatest Liberty Of Subjects, Dependeth On The Silence Of The Law"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5488,"As for other Lyberties, they depend on the silence of the Law. In cases"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5489,"where the Soveraign has prescribed no rule, there the Subject hath"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5490,"the liberty to do, or forbeare, according to his own discretion. And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5491,"therefore such Liberty is in some places more, and in some lesse; and in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5492,"some times more, in other times lesse, according as they that have the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5493,"Soveraignty shall think most convenient. As for Example, there was"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5494,"a time, when in England a man might enter in to his own Land,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5495,(and dispossesse such as wrongfully possessed it) by force. But in
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5496,"after-times, that Liberty of Forcible entry, was taken away by a Statute"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5497,"made (by the King) in Parliament. And is some places of the world, men"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5498,"have the Liberty of many wives: in other places, such Liberty is not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5499,allowed.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5500,"If a Subject have a controversie with his Soveraigne, of Debt, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5501,"of right of possession of lands or goods, or concerning any service"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5502,"required at his hands, or concerning any penalty corporall, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5503,"pecuniary, grounded on a precedent Law; He hath the same Liberty to sue"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5504,"for his right, as if it were against a Subject; and before such Judges,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5505,as are appointed by the Soveraign. For seeing the Soveraign demandeth
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5506,"by force of a former Law, and not by vertue of his Power; he declareth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5507,"thereby, that he requireth no more, than shall appear to be due by that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5508,Law. The sute therefore is not contrary to the will of the Soveraign;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5509,and consequently the Subject hath the Liberty to demand the hearing of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5510,"his Cause; and sentence, according to that Law. But if he demand, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5511,"take any thing by pretence of his Power; there lyeth, in that case, no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5512,"action of Law: for all that is done by him in Vertue of his Power, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5513,"done by the Authority of every subject, and consequently, he that brings"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5514,"an action against the Soveraign, brings it against himselfe."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5515,"If a Monarch, or Soveraign Assembly, grant a Liberty to all, or any of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5516,"his Subjects; which Grant standing, he is disabled to provide for their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5517,"safety, the Grant is voyd; unlesse he directly renounce, or transferre"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5518,"the Soveraignty to another. For in that he might openly, (if it had been"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5519,"his will,) and in plain termes, have renounced, or transferred it, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5520,did not; it is to be understood it was not his will; but that the Grant
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5521,proceeded from ignorance of the repugnancy between such a Liberty and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5522,the Soveraign Power; and therefore the Soveraignty is still retayned;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5523,"and consequently all those Powers, which are necessary to the exercising"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5524,"thereof; such as are the Power of Warre, and Peace, of Judicature, of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5525,"appointing Officers, and Councellours, of levying Mony, and the rest"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5526,named in the 18th Chapter.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5527,In What Cases Subjects Absolved Of Their Obedience To Their Soveraign
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5528,The Obligation of Subjects to the Soveraign is understood to last as
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5529,"long, and no longer, than the power lasteth, by which he is able to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5530,"protect them. For the right men have by Nature to protect themselves,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5531,"when none else can protect them, can by no Covenant be relinquished. The"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5532,Soveraignty is the Soule of the Common-wealth; which once departed from
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5533,"the Body, the members doe no more receive their motion from it. The end"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5534,"of Obedience is Protection; which, wheresoever a man seeth it, either in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5535,"his own, or in anothers sword, Nature applyeth his obedience to it, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5536,"his endeavour to maintaine it. And though Soveraignty, in the intention"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5537,"of them that make it, be immortall; yet is it in its own nature, not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5538,"only subject to violent death, by forreign war; but also through"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5539,"the ignorance, and passions of men, it hath in it, from the very"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5540,"institution, many seeds of a naturall mortality, by Intestine Discord."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5541,In Case Of Captivity
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5542,"If a Subject be taken prisoner in war; or his person, or his means of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5543,"life be within the Guards of the enemy, and hath his life and corporall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5544,"Libertie given him, on condition to be Subject to the Victor, he hath"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5545,"Libertie to accept the condition; and having accepted it, is the subject"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5546,of him that took him; because he had no other way to preserve himselfe.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5547,"The case is the same, if he be deteined on the same termes, in a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5548,"forreign country. But if a man be held in prison, or bonds, or is not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5549,trusted with the libertie of his bodie; he cannot be understood to be
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5550,"bound by Covenant to subjection; and therefore may, if he can, make his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5551,escape by any means whatsoever.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5552,In Case The Soveraign Cast Off The Government From Himself And Heyrs
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5553,"If a Monarch shall relinquish the Soveraignty, both for himself, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5554,his heires; His Subjects returne to the absolute Libertie of Nature;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5555,"because, though Nature may declare who are his Sons, and who are the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5556,"nerest of his Kin; yet it dependeth on his own will, (as hath been said"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5557,"in the precedent chapter,) who shall be his Heyr. If therefore he will"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5558,"have no Heyre, there is no Soveraignty, nor Subjection. The case is the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5559,"same, if he dye without known Kindred, and without declaration of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5560,"his Heyre. For then there can no Heire be known, and consequently no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5561,Subjection be due.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5562,In Case Of Banishment
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5563,"If the Soveraign Banish his Subject; during the Banishment, he is not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5564,"Subject. But he that is sent on a message, or hath leave to travell, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5565,"still Subject; but it is, by Contract between Soveraigns, not by vertue"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5566,of the covenant of Subjection. For whosoever entreth into anothers
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5567,"dominion, is Subject to all the Lawes thereof; unless he have a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5568,"privilege by the amity of the Soveraigns, or by speciall licence."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5569,In Case The Soveraign Render Himself Subject To Another
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5570,"If a Monarch subdued by war, render himself Subject to the Victor; his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5571,"Subjects are delivered from their former obligation, and become obliged"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5572,"to the Victor. But if he be held prisoner, or have not the liberty"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5573,of his own Body; he is not understood to have given away the Right of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5574,Soveraigntie; and therefore his Subjects are obliged to yield obedience
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5575,"to the Magistrates formerly placed, governing not in their own name,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5576,"but in his. For, his Right remaining, the question is only of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5577,"Administration; that is to say, of the Magistrates and Officers; which,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5578,"if he have not means to name, he is supposed to approve those, which he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,21,5579,himself had formerly appointed.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5580,"CHAPTER XXII. OF SYSTEMES SUBJECT, POLITICALL, AND PRIVATE"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5581,The Divers Sorts Of Systemes Of People
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5582,"Having spoken of the Generation, Forme, and Power of a Common-wealth, I"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5583,"am in order to speak next of the parts thereof. And first of Systemes,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5584,"which resemble the similar parts, or Muscles of a Body naturall. By"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5585,"SYSTEMES; I understand any numbers of men joyned in one Interest, or one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5586,"Businesse. Of which, some are Regular, and some Irregular. Regular are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5587,"those, where one Man, or Assembly of men, is constituted Representative"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5588,of the whole number. All other are Irregular.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5589,"Of Regular, some are Absolute, and Independent, subject to none but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5590,their own Representative: such are only Common-wealths; Of which I have
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5591,spoken already in the 5. last preceding chapters. Others are Dependent;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5592,"that is to say, Subordinate to some Soveraign Power, to which every one,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5593,as also their Representative is Subject.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5594,"Of Systemes subordinate, some are Politicall, and some Private."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5595,"Politicall (otherwise Called Bodies Politique, and Persons In Law,)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5596,"are those, which are made by authority from the Soveraign Power of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5597,"Common-wealth. Private, are those, which are constituted by Subjects"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5598,"amongst themselves, or by authoritie from a stranger. For no authority"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5599,"derived from forraign power, within the Dominion of another, is Publique"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5600,"there, but Private."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5601,"And of Private Systemes, some are Lawfull; some Unlawfull: Lawfull, are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5602,those which are allowed by the Common-wealth: all other are Unlawfull.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5603,"Irregular Systemes, are those which having no Representative,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5604,consist only in concourse of People; which if not forbidden by the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5605,"Common-wealth, nor made on evill designe, (such as are conflux of People"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5606,"to markets, or shews, or any other harmelesse end,) are Lawfull. But"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5607,"when the Intention is evill, or (if the number be considerable) unknown,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5608,they are Unlawfull.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5609,In All Bodies Politique The Power Of The Representative Is Limited
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5610,"In Bodies Politique, the power of the Representative is alwaies Limited:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5611,"And that which prescribeth the limits thereof, is the Power Soveraign."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5612,"For Power Unlimited, is absolute Soveraignty. And the Soveraign, in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5613,"every Commonwealth, is the absolute Representative of all the Subjects;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5614,"and therefore no other, can be Representative of any part of them,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5615,"but so far forth, as he shall give leave; And to give leave to a Body"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5616,"Politique of Subjects, to have an absolute Representative to all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5617,"intents and purposes, were to abandon the Government of so much of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5618,"Commonwealth, and to divide the Dominion, contrary to their Peace and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5619,"Defence, which the Soveraign cannot be understood to doe, by any Grant,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5620,"that does not plainly, and directly discharge them of their subjection."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5621,"For consequences of words, are not the signes of his will, when other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5622,"consequences are signes of the contrary; but rather signes of errour,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5623,and misreckoning; to which all mankind is too prone.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5624,"The bounds of that Power, which is given to the Representative of a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5625,"Bodie Politique, are to be taken notice of, from two things. One is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5626,"their Writt, or Letters from the Soveraign: the other is the Law of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5627,Common-wealth.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5628,By Letters Patents
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5629,"For though in the Institution or Acquisition of a Common-wealth,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5630,"which is independent, there needs no Writing, because the Power of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5631,"Representative has there no other bounds, but such as are set out by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5632,"the unwritten Law of Nature; yet in subordinate bodies, there are such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5633,"diversities of Limitation necessary, concerning their businesses, times,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5634,"and places, as can neither be remembred without Letters, nor taken"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5635,"notice of, unlesse such Letters be Patent, that they may be read to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5636,"them, and withall sealed, or testified, with the Seales, or other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5637,permanent signes of the Authority Soveraign.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5638,And The Lawes
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5639,"And because such Limitation is not alwaies easie, or perhaps possible"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5640,"to be described in writing; the ordinary Lawes, common to all Subjects,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5641,"must determine, that the Representative may lawfully do, in all Cases,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5642,where the Letters themselves are silent. And therefore
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5643,"When The Representative Is One Man, His Unwarranted Acts His Own Onely"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5644,"In a Body Politique, if the Representative be one man, whatsoever he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5645,"does in the Person of the Body, which is not warranted in his Letters,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5646,"nor by the Lawes, is his own act, and not the act of the Body, nor of"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5648,"Letters, or the Lawes limit, he representeth no mans person, but his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5649,"own. But what he does according to these, is the act of every one: For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5650,"of the Act of the Soveraign every one is Author, because he is their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5651,Representative unlimited; and the act of him that recedes not from the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5652,"Letters of the Soveraign, is the act of the Soveraign, and therefore"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5653,every member of the Body is Author of it.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5654,"When It Is An Assembly, It Is The Act Of Them That Assented Onely"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5655,"But if the Representative be an Assembly, whatsoever that Assembly shall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5656,"Decree, not warranted by their Letters, or the Lawes, is the act of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5657,"Assembly, or Body Politique, and the act of every one by whose Vote the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5658,Decree was made; but not the act of any man that being present Voted to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5659,"the contrary; nor of any man absent, unlesse he Voted it by procuration."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5660,"It is the act of the Assembly, because Voted by the major part; and if"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5661,"it be a crime, the Assembly may be punished, as farre-forth as it is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5662,"capable, as by dissolution, or forfeiture of their Letters (which is to"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5665,"propriety,) by pecuniary Mulct. For from corporall penalties Nature hath"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5666,"exempted all Bodies Politique. But they that gave not their Vote, are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5667,"therefore Innocent, because the Assembly cannot Represent any man in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5668,"things unwarranted by their Letters, and consequently are not involved"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5669,in their Votes.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5670,"When The Representative Is One Man, If He Borrow Mony, Or Owe It, By"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5673,"that is not of the same Body, (for no Letters need limit borrowing,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5674,seeing it is left to mens own inclinations to limit lending) the debt is
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5675,"the Representatives. For if he should have Authority from his Letters,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5676,"to make the members pay what he borroweth, he should have by consequence"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5677,"the Soveraignty of them; and therefore the grant were either voyd,"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5681,"present question, which is onely of Bodies subordinate. No member"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5682,"therefore is obliged to pay the debt so borrowed, but the Representative"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5683,"himselfe: because he that lendeth it, being a stranger to the Letters,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5684,"and to the qualification of the Body, understandeth those onely for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5685,"his debtors, that are engaged; and seeing the Representer can ingage"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5686,"himselfe, and none else, has him onely for Debtor; who must therefore"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5694,the fact for which the Mulct was imposed; because every one of those in
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5695,voting did engage himselfe for the payment: For he that is author of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5696,"the borrowing, is obliged to the payment, even of the whole debt, though"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5697,"when payd by any one, he be discharged."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5698,"If The Debt Be To One Of The Assembly, The Body Onely Is Obliged"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5700,"to the payment, out of their common stock (if they have any:) For having"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5701,"liberty of Vote, if he Vote the Mony, shall be borrowed, he Votes it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5702,"shall be payd; If he Vote it shall not be borrowed, or be absent, yet"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5703,"because in lending, he voteth the borrowing, he contradicteth his former"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5704,"Vote, and is obliged by the later, and becomes both borrower and lender,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5705,"and consequently cannot demand payment from any particular man, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5706,"from the common Treasure onely; which fayling he hath no remedy, nor"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5710,Protestation Against The Decrees Of Bodies Politique
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5711,Sometimes Lawful; But Against Soveraign Power Never It is manifest by
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5712,"this, that in Bodies Politique subordinate, and subject to a Soveraign"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5713,"Power, it is sometimes not onely lawfull, but expedient, for a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5714,particular man to make open protestation against the decrees of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5715,"Representative Assembly, and cause their dissent to be Registred, or to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5716,take witnesse of it; because otherwise they may be obliged to pay debts
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5717,"contracted, and be responsible for crimes committed by other men: But in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5718,"a Soveraign Assembly, that liberty is taken away, both because he that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5719,"protesteth there, denies their Soveraignty; and also because whatsoever"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5720,"is commanded by the Soveraign Power, is as to the Subject (though not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5721,so alwayes in the sight of God) justified by the Command; for of such
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5722,command every Subject is the Author.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5723,"Bodies Politique For Government Of A Province, Colony, Or Town"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5724,"The variety of Bodies Politique, is almost infinite; for they are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5725,"not onely distinguished by the severall affaires, for which they are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5726,"constituted, wherein there is an unspeakable diversitie; but also by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5727,"times, places, and numbers, subject to many limitations. And as to their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5728,"affaires, some are ordained for Government; As first, the Government"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5729,"of a Province may be committed to an Assembly of men, wherein all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5730,resolutions shall depend on the Votes of the major part; and then this
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5731,"Assembly is a Body Politique, and their power limited by Commission."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5732,"This word Province signifies a charge, or care of businesse, which he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5733,"whose businesse it is, committeth to another man, to be administred for,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5734,and under him; and therefore when in one Common-wealth there be divers
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5735,"Countries, that have their Lawes distinct one from another, or are farre"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5736,"distant in place, the Administration of the Government being committed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5737,"to divers persons, those Countries where the Soveraign is not resident,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5738,"but governs by Commission, are called Provinces. But of the government"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5739,"of a Province, by an Assembly residing in the Province it selfe, there"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5740,be few examples. The Romans who had the Soveraignty of many Provinces;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5741,"yet governed them alwaies by Presidents, and Praetors; and not by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5742,"Assemblies, as they governed the City of Rome, and Territories adjacent."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5743,"In like manner, when there were Colonies sent from England, to Plant"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5744,"Virginia, and Sommer-Ilands; though the government of them here, were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5745,"committed to Assemblies in London, yet did those Assemblies never"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5746,commit the Government under them to any Assembly there; but did to each
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5747,"Plantation send one Governour; For though every man, where he can be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5748,"present by Nature, desires to participate of government; yet where"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5749,"they cannot be present, they are by Nature also enclined, to commit the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5750,"Government of their common Interest rather to a Monarchicall, then a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5751,Popular form of Government: which is also evident in those men that have
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5752,great private estates; who when they are unwilling to take the paines of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5753,"administring the businesse that belongs to them, choose rather to trust"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5754,"one Servant, than a Assembly either of their friends or servants."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5755,"But howsoever it be in fact, yet we may suppose the Government of a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5756,"Province, or Colony committed to an Assembly: and when it is, that which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5757,"in this place I have to say, is this; that whatsoever debt is by that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5758,"Assembly contracted; or whatsoever unlawfull Act is decreed, is the Act"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5759,"onely of those that assented, and not of any that dissented, or were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5760,"absent, for the reasons before alledged. Also that an Assembly residing"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5761,"out of the bounds of that Colony whereof they have the government,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5762,"cannot execute any power over the persons, or goods of any of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5763,"Colonie, to seize on them for debt, or other duty, in any place"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5764,"without the Colony it selfe, as having no Jurisdiction, nor Authoritie"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5765,"elsewhere, but are left to the remedie, which the Law of the place"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5766,"alloweth them. And though the Assembly have right, to impose a Mulct"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5767,"upon any of their members, that shall break the Lawes they make; yet"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5768,"out of the Colonie it selfe, they have no right to execute the same."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5769,"And that which is said here, of the Rights of an Assembly, for the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5770,"government of a Province, or a Colony, is appliable also to an Assembly"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5771,"for the Government of a Town, or University, or a College, or a Church,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5772,or for any other Government over the persons of men.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5773,"And generally, in all Bodies Politique, if any particular member"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5774,"conceive himself Injured by the Body it self, the Cognisance of his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5775,"cause belongeth to the Soveraign, and those the Soveraign hath ordained"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5776,"for Judges in such causes, or shall ordaine for that particular cause;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5777,and not to the Body it self. For the whole Body is in this case his
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5778,"fellow subject, which in a Soveraign Assembly, is otherwise: for there,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5779,"if the Soveraign be not Judge, though in his own cause, there can be no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5780,Judge at all.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5781,Bodies Politique For Ordering Of Trade
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5782,"In a Bodie Politique, for the well ordering of forraigne Traffique, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5783,most commodious Representative is an Assembly of all the members; that
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5784,"is to say, such a one, as every one that adventureth his mony, may be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5785,"present at all the Deliberations, and Resolutions of the Body, if they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5786,"will themselves. For proof whereof, we are to consider the end, for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5787,"which men that are Merchants, and may buy and sell, export, and import"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5788,"their Merchandise, according to their own discretions, doe neverthelesse"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5789,"bind themselves up in one Corporation. It is true, there be few"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5790,"Merchants, that with the Merchandise they buy at home, can fraight a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5791,"Ship, to export it; or with that they buy abroad, to bring it home; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5792,have therefore need to joyn together in one Society; where every man
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5793,"may either participate of the gaine, according to the proportion of his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5794,"adventure; or take his own; and sell what he transports, or imports, at"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5795,"such prices as he thinks fit. But this is no Body Politique, there being"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5796,"no Common Representative to oblige them to any other Law, than that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5797,"which is common to all other subjects. The End of their Incorporating,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5798,is to make their gaine the greater; which is done two wayes; by sole
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5799,"buying, and sole selling, both at home, and abroad. So that to grant"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5800,"to a Company of Merchants to be a Corporation, or Body Politique, is to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5801,"grant them a double Monopoly, whereof one is to be sole buyers; another"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5802,to be sole sellers. For when there is a Company incorporate for any
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5803,"particular forraign Country, they only export the Commodities vendible"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5804,"in that Country; which is sole buying at home, and sole selling abroad."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5805,"For at home there is but one buyer, and abroad but one that selleth:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5806,"both which is gainfull to the Merchant, because thereby they buy at home"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5807,"at lower, and sell abroad at higher rates: And abroad there is but one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5808,"buyer of forraign Merchandise, and but one that sels them at home; both"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5809,which againe are gainfull to the adventurers.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5810,Of this double Monopoly one part is disadvantageous to the people at
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5811,"home, the other to forraigners. For at home by their sole exportation"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5812,they set what price they please on the husbandry and handy-works of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5813,"the people; and by the sole importation, what price they please on all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5814,forraign commodities the people have need of; both which are ill for the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5815,"people. On the contrary, by the sole selling of the native commodities"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5816,"abroad, and sole buying the forraign commodities upon the place,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5817,"they raise the price of those, and abate the price of these, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5818,"the disadvantage of the forraigner: For where but one selleth, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5819,Merchandise is the dearer; and where but one buyeth the cheaper: Such
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5820,Corporations therefore are no other then Monopolies; though they would
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5821,"be very profitable for a Common-wealth, if being bound up into one body"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5822,"in forraigne Markets they were at liberty at home, every man to buy, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5823,sell at what price he could.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5824,"The end then of these Bodies of Merchants, being not a Common benefit"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5825,"to the whole Body, (which have in this case no common stock, but what"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5826,"is deducted out of the particular adventures, for building, buying,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5827,"victualling and manning of Ships,) but the particular gaine of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5828,"every adventurer, it is reason that every one be acquainted with the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5829,"employment of his own; that is, that every one be of the Assembly, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5830,shall have the power to order the same; and be acquainted with their
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5831,accounts. And therefore the Representative of such a Body must be
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5832,"an Assembly, where every member of the Body may be present at the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5833,"consultations, if he will."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5834,"If a Body Politique of Merchants, contract a debt to a stranger by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5835,"act of their Representative Assembly, every Member is lyable by himself"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5836,"for the whole. For a stranger can take no notice of their private Lawes,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5837,"but considereth them as so many particular men, obliged every one to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5838,"whole payment, till payment made by one dischargeth all the rest: But if"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5839,"the debt be to one of the Company, the creditor is debter for the whole"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5840,"to himself, and cannot therefore demand his debt, but only from the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5841,"common stock, if there be any."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5842,"If the Common-wealth impose a Tax upon the Body, it is understood to be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5843,layd upon every member proportionably to his particular adventure in the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5844,"Company. For there is in this case no other common stock, but what is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5845,made of their particular adventures.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5846,"If a Mulct be layd upon the Body for some unlawfull act, they only are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5847,"lyable by whose votes the act was decreed, or by whose assistance it was"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5848,executed; for in none of the rest is there any other crime but being
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5849,"of the Body; which if a crime, (because the Body was ordeyned by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5850,"authority of the Common-wealth,) is not his."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5851,"If one of the Members be indebted to the Body, he may be sued by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5852,"Body; but his goods cannot be taken, nor his person imprisoned by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5853,authority of the Body; but only by Authority of the Common-wealth:
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5854,"for if they can doe it by their own Authority, they can by their own"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5855,"Authority give judgement that the debt is due, which is as much as to be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5856,Judge in their own Cause.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5857,A Bodie Politique For Counsel To Be Give To The Soveraign
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5858,"These Bodies made for the government of Men, or of Traffique, be either"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5859,"perpetuall, or for a time prescribed by writing. But there be Bodies"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5860,"also whose times are limited, and that only by the nature of their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5861,"businesse. For example, if a Soveraign Monarch, or a Soveraign Assembly,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5862,"shall think fit to give command to the towns, and other severall parts"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5863,"of their territory, to send to him their Deputies, to enforme him of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5864,"condition, and necessities of the Subjects, or to advise with him for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5865,"the making of good Lawes, or for any other cause, as with one Person"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5867,"of meeting assigned them, are there, and at that time, a Body Politique,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5868,representing every Subject of that Dominion; but it is onely for such
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5869,"matters as shall be propounded unto them by that Man, or Assembly, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5870,by the Soveraign Authority sent for them; and when it shall be declared
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5871,"that nothing more shall be propounded, nor debated by them, the Body is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5872,"dissolved. For if they were the absolute Representative of the people,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5873,then were it the Soveraign Assembly; and so there would be two Soveraign
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5874,"Assemblies, or two Soveraigns, over the same people; which cannot"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5875,consist with their Peace. And therefore where there is once a
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5876,"Soveraignty, there can be no absolute Representation of the people, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5877,by it. And for the limits of how farre such a Body shall represent the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5878,"whole People, they are set forth in the Writing by which they were sent"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5879,"for. For the People cannot choose their Deputies to other intent, than"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5880,is in the Writing directed to them from their Soveraign expressed.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5881,"A Regular Private Body, Lawfull, As A Family"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5882,"Private Bodies Regular, and Lawfull, are those that are constituted"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5883,"without Letters, or other written Authority, saving the Lawes common"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5884,to all other Subjects. And because they be united in one Person
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5885,"Representative, they are held for Regular; such as are all Families, in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5886,"which the Father, or Master ordereth the whole Family. For he obligeth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5887,"his Children, and Servants, as farre as the Law permitteth, though not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5888,"further, because none of them are bound to obedience in those actions,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5889,"which the Law hath forbidden to be done. In all other actions, during"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5890,"the time they are under domestique government, they are subject to their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5891,"Fathers, and Masters, as to their immediate Soveraigns. For the Father,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5892,"and Master being before the Institution of Common-wealth, absolute"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5893,"Soveraigns in their own Families, they lose afterward no more of their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5894,"Authority, than the Law of the Common-wealth taketh from them."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5895,"Private Bodies Regular, But Unlawfull"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5896,"Private Bodies Regular, but Unlawfull, are those that unite themselves"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5897,"into one person Representative, without any publique Authority at all;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5898,"such as are the Corporations of Beggars, Theeves and Gipsies, the better"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5899,"to order their trade of begging, and stealing; and the Corporations of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5900,"men, that by Authority from any forraign Person, unite themselves in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5901,"anothers Dominion, for easier propagation of Doctrines, and for making a"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5903,"Systemes Irregular, Such As Are Private Leagues"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5908,"lawfulnesse, or unlawfulnesse of every particular mans design therein:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5909,And his designe is to be understood by the occasion.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5910,"The Leagues of Subjects, (because Leagues are commonly made for mutuall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5911,"defence,) are in a Common-wealth (which is no more than a League of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5912,"all the Subjects together) for the most part unnecessary, and savour of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5913,"unlawfull designe; and are for that cause Unlawfull, and go commonly by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5914,"the name of factions, or Conspiracies. For a League being a connexion of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5915,"men by Covenants, if there be no power given to any one Man or Assembly,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5916,"(as in the condition of meer Nature) to compell them to performance,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5917,"is so long onely valid, as there ariseth no just cause of distrust: and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5918,"therefore Leagues between Common-wealths, over whom there is no humane"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5919,"Power established, to keep them all in awe, are not onely lawfull, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5920,also profitable for the time they last. But Leagues of the Subjects of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5921,"one and the same Common-wealth, where every one may obtain his right"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5922,"by means of the Soveraign Power, are unnecessary to the maintaining of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5923,"Peace and Justice, and (in case the designe of them be evill, or Unknown"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5924,to the Common-wealth) unlawfull. For all uniting of strength by private
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5925,"men, is, if for evill intent, unjust; if for intent unknown, dangerous"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5926,"to the Publique, and unjustly concealed."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5927,Secret Cabals
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5928,"If the Soveraign Power be in a great Assembly, and a number of men,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5929,"part of the Assembly, without authority, consult a part, to contrive"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5930,"the guidance of the rest; This is a Faction, or Conspiracy unlawfull,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5931,as being a fraudulent seducing of the Assembly for their particular
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5932,"interest. But if he, whose private interest is to be debated, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5933,"judged in the Assembly, make as many friends as he can; in him it is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5934,no Injustice; because in this case he is no part of the Assembly. And
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5935,"though he hire such friends with mony, (unlesse there be an expresse Law"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5936,"against it,) yet it is not Injustice. For sometimes, (as mens manners"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5937,"are,) Justice cannot be had without mony; and every man may think his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5938,"own cause just, till it be heard, and judged."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5939,Feuds Of Private Families
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5940,"In all Common-wealths, if a private man entertain more servants, than"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5941,"the government of his estate, and lawfull employment he has for them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5942,"requires, it is Faction, and unlawfull. For having the protection of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5943,"Common-wealth, he needeth not the defence of private force. And whereas"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5944,"in Nations not throughly civilized, severall numerous Families have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5945,"lived in continuall hostility, and invaded one another with private"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5946,"force; yet it is evident enough, that they have done unjustly; or else"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5947,that they had no Common-wealth.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5948,Factions For Government
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5949,"And as Factions for Kindred, so also Factions for Government of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5950,"Religion, as of Papists, Protestants, &c. or of State, as Patricians,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5951,"and Plebeians of old time in Rome, and of Aristocraticalls and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5952,"Democraticalls of old time in Greece, are unjust, as being contrary to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5953,"the peace and safety of the people, and a taking of the Sword out of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5954,hand of the Soveraign.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5955,"Concourse of people, is an Irregular Systeme, the lawfulnesse, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5956,"unlawfulnesse, whereof dependeth on the occasion, and on the number of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5957,"them that are assembled. If the occasion be lawfull, and manifest, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5958,"Concourse is lawfull; as the usuall meeting of men at Church, or at a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5959,"publique Shew, in usuall numbers: for if the numbers be extraordinarily"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5960,"great, the occasion is not evident; and consequently he that cannot"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5961,"render a particular and good account of his being amongst them, is to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5962,"be judged conscious of an unlawfull, and tumultuous designe. It may be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5963,"lawfull for a thousand men, to joyn in a Petition to be delivered to a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5964,"Judge, or Magistrate; yet if a thousand men come to present it, it is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5965,a tumultuous Assembly; because there needs but one or two for that
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5966,"purpose. But in such cases as these, it is not a set number that makes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5967,"the Assembly Unlawfull, but such a number, as the present Officers are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5968,"not able to suppresse, and bring to Justice."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5969,"When an unusuall number of men, assemble against a man whom they accuse;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5970,the Assembly is an Unlawfull tumult; because they may deliver their
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5971,"accusation to the Magistrate by a few, or by one man. Such was the case"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5972,"of St. Paul at Ephesus; where Demetrius, and a great number of other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5973,"men, brought two of Pauls companions before the Magistrate, saying with"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5974,"one Voyce, ""Great is Diana of the Ephesians;"" which was their way of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5975,"demanding Justice against them for teaching the people such doctrine,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5976,"as was against their Religion, and Trade. The occasion here, considering"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5977,"the Lawes of that People, was just; yet was their Assembly Judged"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5978,"Unlawfull, and the Magistrate reprehended them for it, in these"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5979,"words,(Acts 19. 40) ""If Demetrius and the other work-men can accuse any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5980,"man, of any thing, there be Pleas, and Deputies, let them accuse one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5981,"another. And if you have any other thing to demand, your case may"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5982,be judged in an Assembly Lawfully called. For we are in danger to be
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5983,"accused for this dayes sedition, because, there is no cause by which any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5984,"man can render any reason of this Concourse of People."" Where he calleth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5985,"an Assembly, whereof men can give no just account, a Sedition, and such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5986,as they could not answer for. And this is all I shall say concerning
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5987,"Systemes, and Assemblyes of People, which may be compared (as I said,)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5988,"to the Similar parts of mans Body; such as be Lawfull, to the Muscles;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5989,"such as are Unlawfull, to Wens, Biles, and Apostemes, engendred by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,22,5990,unnaturall conflux of evill humours.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,5991,CHAPTER XXIII. OF THE PUBLIQUE MINISTERS OF SOVERAIGN POWER
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,5992,In the last Chapter I have spoken of the Similar parts of a
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,5993,"Common-wealth; In this I shall speak of the parts Organicall, which are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,5994,Publique Ministers.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,5995,Publique Minister Who
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,5996,"A PUBLIQUE MINISTER, is he, that by the Soveraign, (whether a Monarch,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,5997,"or an Assembly,) is employed in any affaires, with Authority to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,5998,"represent in that employment, the Person of the Common-wealth. And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,5999,"whereas every man, or assembly that hath Soveraignty, representeth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6000,"two Persons, or (as the more common phrase is) has two Capacities, one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6001,"Naturall, and another Politique, (as a Monarch, hath the person not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6002,"onely of the Common-wealth, but also of a man; and a Soveraign Assembly"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6003,"hath the Person not onely of the Common-wealth, but also of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6004,"Assembly); they that be servants to them in their naturall Capacity,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6005,are not Publique Ministers; but those onely that serve them in the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6006,"Administration of the Publique businesse. And therefore neither Ushers,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6007,"nor Sergeants, nor other Officers that waite on the Assembly, for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6008,"no other purpose, but for the commodity of the men assembled, in an"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6009,"Aristocracy, or Democracy; nor Stewards, Chamberlains, Cofferers, or any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6010,"other Officers of the houshold of a Monarch, are Publique Ministers in a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6011,Monarchy.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6012,Ministers For The Generall Administration
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6013,"Of Publique Ministers, some have charge committed to them of a general"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6014,"Administration, either of the whole Dominion, or of a part thereof."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6015,"Of the whole, as to a Protector, or Regent, may bee committed by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6016,"the Predecessor of an Infant King, during his minority, the whole"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6017,"Administration of his Kingdome. In which case, every Subject is so far"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6018,"obliged to obedience, as the Ordinances he shall make, and the commands"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6019,"he shall give be in the Kings name, and not inconsistent with his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6020,"Soveraigne Power. Of a Part, or Province; as when either a Monarch, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6021,"a Soveraign Assembly, shall give the generall charge thereof to a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6022,"Governour, Lieutenant, Praefect, or Vice-Roy: And in this case also,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6023,"every one of that Province, is obliged to all he shall doe in the name"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6024,"of the Soveraign, and that not incompatible with the Soveraigns Right."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6025,"For such Protectors, Vice-Roys, and Governours, have no other right, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6026,what depends on the Soveraigns Will; and no Commission that can be given
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6027,"them, can be interpreted for a Declaration of the will to transferre the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6028,"Soveraignty, without expresse and perspicuous words to that purpose. And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6029,"this kind of Publique Ministers resembleth the Nerves, and Tendons that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6030,move the severall limbs of a body naturall.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6031,"For Speciall Administration, As For Oeconomy"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6032,"Others have speciall Administration; that is to say, charges of some"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6033,"speciall businesse, either at home, or abroad: As at home, First, for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6034,"the Oeconomy of a Common-wealth, They that have Authority concerning the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6035,"Treasure, as Tributes, Impositions, Rents, Fines, or whatsoever publique"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6036,"revenue, to collect, receive, issue, or take the Accounts thereof,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6037,"are Publique Ministers: Ministers, because they serve the Person"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6038,"Representative, and can doe nothing against his Command, nor without his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6039,"Authority: Publique, because they serve him in his Politicall Capacity."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6040,"Secondly, they that have Authority concerning the Militia; to have the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6041,"custody of Armes, Forts, Ports; to Levy, Pay, or Conduct Souldiers; or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6042,"to provide for any necessary thing for the use of war, either by Land or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6043,"Sea, are publique Ministers. But a Souldier without Command, though he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6044,"fight for the Common-wealth, does not therefore represent the Person of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6045,it; because there is none to represent it to. For every one that hath
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6046,"command, represents it to them only whom he commandeth."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6047,For Instruction Of The People
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6048,"They also that have authority to teach, or to enable others to teach"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6049,"the people their duty to the Soveraign Power, and instruct them in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6050,"knowledge of what is just, and unjust, thereby to render them more apt"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6051,"to live in godlinesse, and in peace among themselves, and resist the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6052,"publique enemy, are Publique Ministers: Ministers, in that they doe it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6053,"not by their own Authority, but by anothers; and Publique, because they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6054,"doe it (or should doe it) by no Authority, but that of the Soveraign."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6055,"The Monarch, or the Soveraign Assembly only hath immediate Authority"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6056,"from God, to teach and instruct the people; and no man but the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6057,"Soveraign, receiveth his power Dei Gratia simply; that is to say, from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6058,"the favour of none but God: All other, receive theirs from the favour"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6059,"and providence of God, and their Soveraigns; as in a Monarchy Dei Gratia"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6060,& Regis; or Dei Providentia & Voluntate Regis.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6061,For Judicature
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6062,"They also to whom Jurisdiction is given, are Publique Ministers. For in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6063,their Seats of Justice they represent the person of the Soveraign; and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6064,"their Sentence, is his Sentence; For (as hath been before declared) all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6065,Judicature is essentially annexed to the Soveraignty; and therefore all
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6066,"other Judges are but Ministers of him, or them that have the Soveraign"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6067,"Power. And as Controversies are of two sorts, namely of Fact, and of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6068,"Law; so are judgements, some of Fact, some of Law: And consequently in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6069,"the same controversie, there may be two Judges, one of Fact, another of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6070,Law.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6071,"And in both these controversies, there may arise a controversie between"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6072,"the party Judged, and the Judge; which because they be both Subjects to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6073,"the Soveraign, ought in Equity to be Judged by men agreed on by consent"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6074,of both; for no man can be Judge in his own cause. But the Soveraign
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6075,"is already agreed on for Judge by them both, and is therefore either to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6076,"heare the Cause, and determine it himself, or appoint for Judge such as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6077,they shall both agree on. And this agreement is then understood to be
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6078,"made between them divers wayes; as first, if the Defendant be allowed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6079,"to except against such of his Judges, whose interest maketh him suspect"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6080,"them, (for as to the Complaynant he hath already chosen his own Judge,)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6081,"those which he excepteth not against, are Judges he himself agrees on."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6082,"Secondly, if he appeale to any other Judge, he can appeale no further;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6083,"for his appeale is his choice. Thirdly, if he appeale to the Soveraign"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6084,"himself, and he by himself, or by Delegates which the parties shall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6085,"agree on, give Sentence; that Sentence is finall: for the Defendant is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6086,"Judged by his own Judges, that is to say, by himself."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6087,"These properties of just and rationall Judicature considered, I cannot"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6088,"forbeare to observe the excellent constitution of the Courts of Justice,"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6093,"were two orders of men, whereof one was Lords, the other Commons; The"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6094,"Lords had this Priviledge, to have for Judges in all Capitall crimes,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6095,"none but Lords; and of them, as many as would be present; which being"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6096,"ever acknowledged as a Priviledge of favour, their Judges were none but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6097,"such as they had themselves desired. And in all controversies, every"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6098,"Subject (as also in civill controversies the Lords) had for Judges, men"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6099,of the Country where the matter in controversie lay; against which he
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6100,"might make his exceptions, till at last Twelve men without exception"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6101,"being agreed on, they were Judged by those twelve. So that having"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6102,"his own Judges, there could be nothing alledged by the party, why the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6103,"sentence should not be finall, These publique persons, with Authority"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6104,"from the Soveraign Power, either to Instruct, or Judge the people,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6105,"are such members of the Common-wealth, as may fitly be compared to the"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6108,"Publique Ministers are also all those, that have Authority from the"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6121,Private Ministers of the Common-wealth; because none of their actions
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6122,"have the Common-wealth for Author. Likewise, an Ambassador sent from a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6123,"Prince, to congratulate, condole, or to assist at a solemnity, though"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,23,6127,"and strength; though both the Authority, and the Businesse be Publique;"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6181,were brought in from other places.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6182,And The Right Of Distribution Of Them
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6183,"The Distribution of the Materials of this Nourishment, is the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6184,"constitution of Mine, and Thine, and His, that is to say, in one word"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6185,Propriety; and belongeth in all kinds of Common-wealth to the Soveraign
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6186,"Power. For where there is no Common-wealth, there is, (as hath been"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6187,already shewn) a perpetuall warre of every man against his neighbour;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6188,"And therefore every thing is his that getteth it, and keepeth it by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6189,force; which is neither Propriety nor Community; but Uncertainty. Which
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6190,"is so evident, that even Cicero, (a passionate defender of Liberty,) in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6191,"a publique pleading, attributeth all Propriety to the Law Civil, ""Let"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6192,"the Civill Law,"" saith he, ""be once abandoned, or but negligently"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6193,"guarded, (not to say oppressed,) and there is nothing, that any man can"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6196,"what another mans."" Seeing therefore the Introduction of Propriety is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6197,an effect of Common-wealth; which can do nothing but by the Person that
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6198,"Represents it, it is the act onely of the Soveraign; and consisteth in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6199,"the Lawes, which none can make that have not the Soveraign Power. And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6200,"this they well knew of old, who called that Nomos, (that is to say,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6201,"Distribution,) which we call Law; and defined Justice, by distributing"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6202,to every man his own.

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6204,From The Arbitrary Distribution Of The Soveraign
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6205,"In this Distribution, the First Law, is for Division of the Land it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6206,"selfe: wherein the Soveraign assigneth to every man a portion, according"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6207,"as he, and not according as any Subject, or any number of them, shall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6208,"judge agreeable to Equity, and the Common Good. The Children of Israel,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6209,were a Common-wealth in the Wildernesse; but wanted the commodities
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6210,"of the Earth, till they were masters of the Land of Promise; which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6211,"afterward was divided amongst them, not by their own discretion, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6212,"by the discretion of Eleazar the Priest, and Joshua their Generall: who"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6213,"when there were twelve Tribes, making them thirteen by subdivision of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6214,the Tribe of Joseph; made neverthelesse but twelve portions of the Land;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6215,and ordained for the Tribe of Levi no land; but assigned them the Tenth
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6216,part of the whole fruits; which division was therefore Arbitrary. And
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6217,"though a People comming into possession of a land by warre, do not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6218,"alwaies exterminate the antient Inhabitants, (as did the Jewes,) but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6219,"leave to many, or most, or all of them their Estates; yet it is manifest"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6220,"they hold them afterwards, as of the Victors distribution; as the people"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6221,of England held all theirs of William the Conquerour.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6222,"Propriety Of A Subject Excludes Not The Dominion Of The Soveraign,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6223,But Onely Of Another Subject
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6224,"From whence we may collect, that the Propriety which a subject hath in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6225,"his lands, consisteth in a right to exclude all other subjects from the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6226,"use of them; and not to exclude their Soveraign, be it an Assembly, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6227,"a Monarch. For seeing the Soveraign, that is to say, the Common-wealth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6228,"(whose Person he representeth,) is understood to do nothing but in order"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6229,"to the common Peace and Security, this Distribution of lands, is to be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6230,"understood as done in order to the same: And consequently, whatsoever"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6231,"Distribution he shall make in prejudice thereof, is contrary to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6232,"will of every subject, that committed his Peace, and safety to his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6233,"discretion, and conscience; and therefore by the will of every one of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6234,"them, is to be reputed voyd. It is true, that a Soveraign Monarch, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6235,"the greater part of a Soveraign Assembly, may ordain the doing of many"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6236,"things in pursuit of their Passions, contrary to their own consciences,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6237,"which is a breach of trust, and of the Law of Nature; but this is not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6238,"enough to authorise any subject, either to make warre upon, or so much"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6239,"as to accuse of Injustice, or any way to speak evill of their Soveraign;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6240,"because they have authorised all his actions, and in bestowing the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6241,"Soveraign Power, made them their own. But in what cases the Commands"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6242,"of Soveraigns are contrary to Equity, and the Law of Nature, is to be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6243,considered hereafter in another place.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6244,The Publique Is Not To Be Dieted
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6245,"In the Distribution of land, the Common-wealth it selfe, may be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6246,"conceived to have a portion, and possesse, and improve the same by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6247,"their Representative; and that such portion may be made sufficient, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6248,"susteine the whole expence to the common Peace, and defence necessarily"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6249,"required: Which were very true, if there could be any Representative"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6250,"conceived free from humane passions, and infirmities. But the nature"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6251,"of men being as it is, the setting forth of Publique Land, or of any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6252,"certaine Revenue for the Common-wealth, is in vaine; and tendeth to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6253,"dissolution of Government, and to the condition of meere Nature, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6254,"War, assoon as ever the Soveraign Power falleth into the hands of a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6255,"Monarch, or of an Assembly, that are either too negligent of mony, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6256,"too hazardous in engaging the publique stock, into a long, or costly"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6257,war. Common-wealths can endure no Diet: For seeing their expence is
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6258,"not limited by their own appetite, but by externall Accidents, and the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6259,"appetites of their neighbours, the Publique Riches cannot be limited by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6260,"other limits, than those which the emergent occasions shall require. And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6261,"whereas in England, there were by the Conquerour, divers Lands"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6262,"reserved to his own use, (besides Forrests, and Chases, either for his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6263,"recreation, or for preservation of Woods,) and divers services reserved"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6264,on the Land he gave his Subjects; yet it seems they were not reserved
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6265,"for his Maintenance in his Publique, but in his Naturall capacity: For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6266,"he, and his Successors did for all that, lay Arbitrary Taxes on all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6267,"Subjects land, when they judged it necessary. Or if those publique"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6268,"Lands, and Services, were ordained as a sufficient maintenance of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6269,"Common-wealth, it was contrary to the scope of the Institution; being"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6270,"(as it appeared by those ensuing Taxes) insufficient, and (as it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6271,"appeares by the late Revenue of the Crown) Subject to Alienation,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6272,"and Diminution. It is therefore in vaine, to assign a portion to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6273,"Common-wealth; which may sell, or give it away; and does sell, and give"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6274,it away when tis done by their Representative.

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6288,"Further, seeing it is not enough to the Sustentation of a Common-wealth,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6289,"that every man have a propriety in a portion of Land, or in some few"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6290,"commodities, or a naturall property in some usefull art, and there is no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6291,"art in the world, but is necessary either for the being, or well being"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6292,"almost of every particular man; it is necessary, that men distribute"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6294,"mutually one to another, by exchange, and mutuall contract. And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6295,"therefore it belongeth to the Common-wealth, (that is to say, to the"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6303,"By Concoction, I understand the reducing of all commodities, which are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6304,"not presently consumed, but reserved for Nourishment in time to come, to"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6313,"Subjects of that Common-wealth. By the means of which measures, all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6314,"commodities, Moveable, and Immoveable, are made to accompany a man, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6315,"all places of his resort, within and without the place of his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6316,"ordinary residence; and the same passeth from Man to Man, within the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6317,"Common-wealth; and goes round about, Nourishing (as it passeth)"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6322,"And because Silver and Gold, have their value from the matter it self;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6323,"they have first this priviledge, that the value of them cannot be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6324,"altered by the power of one, nor of a few Common-wealths; as being a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6325,"common measure of the commodities of all places. But base Mony, may"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6326,"easily be enhanced, or abased. Secondly, they have the priviledge to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6327,"make Common-wealths, move, and stretch out their armes, when need is,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6328,"into forraign Countries; and supply, not only private Subjects that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6329,"travell, but also whole Armies with provision. But that Coyne, which is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6330,"not considerable for the Matter, but for the Stamp of the place, being"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6331,"unable to endure change of ayr, hath its effect at home only; where"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6332,"also it is subject to the change of Laws, and thereby to have the value"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6338,"sort, are Collectors, Receivers, and Treasurers; of the second are the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6339,"Treasurers againe, and the Officers appointed for payment of severall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6340,"publique or private Ministers. And in this also, the Artificiall Man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6341,maintains his resemblance with the Naturall; whose Veins receiving the

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6346,"The Procreation, or Children of a Common-wealth, are those we call"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6347,"Plantations, or Colonies; which are numbers of men sent out from the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6348,"Common-wealth, under a Conductor, or Governour, to inhabit a Forraign"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6349,"Country, either formerly voyd of Inhabitants, or made voyd then, by"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6352,"them, (as hath been done by many Common-wealths of antient time,) in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6353,which case the Common-wealth from which they went was called their
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6354,"Metropolis, or Mother, and requires no more of them, then Fathers"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6355,"require of the Children, whom they emancipate, and make free from their"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6359,parts of the Common-wealth that sent them. So that the Right of Colonies
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,24,6360,"(saving Honour, and League with their Metropolis,) dependeth wholly on"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6363,CHAPTER XXV. OF COUNSELL
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6364,Counsell What
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6365,"How fallacious it is to judge of the nature of things, by the ordinary"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6366,"and inconstant use of words, appeareth in nothing more, than in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6367,"confusion of Counsels, and Commands, arising from the Imperative manner"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6368,"of speaking in them both, and in many other occasions besides. For the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6369,"words ""Doe this,"" are the words not onely of him that Commandeth; but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6370,also of him that giveth Counsell; and of him that Exhorteth; and yet
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6371,"there are but few, that see not, that these are very different things;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6372,"or that cannot distinguish between them, when they perceive who it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6373,"is that speaketh, and to whom the Speech is directed, and upon what"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6374,"occasion. But finding those phrases in mens writings, and being not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6375,"able, or not willing to enter into a consideration of the circumstances,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6376,"they mistake sometimes the Precepts of Counsellours, for the Precepts"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6377,of them that command; and sometimes the contrary; according as it best
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6378,"agreeth with the conclusions they would inferre, or the actions"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6379,"they approve. To avoyd which mistakes, and render to those termes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6380,"of Commanding, Counselling, and Exhorting, their proper and distinct"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6381,"significations, I define them thus."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6382,Differences Between Command And Counsell
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6383,"COMMAND is, where a man saith, ""Doe this,"" or ""Doe this not,"" without"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6384,expecting other reason than the Will of him that sayes it. From this it
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6385,"followeth manifestly, that he that Commandeth, pretendeth thereby his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6386,"own Benefit: For the reason of his Command is his own Will onely, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6387,"the proper object of every mans Will, is some Good to himselfe."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6388,"COUNSELL, is where a man saith, ""Doe"" or ""Doe not this,"" and deduceth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6389,his own reasons from the benefit that arriveth by it to him to whom he
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6390,"saith it. And from this it is evident, that he that giveth Counsell,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6391,"pretendeth onely (whatsoever he intendeth) the good of him, to whom he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6392,giveth it.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6393,"Therefore between Counsell and Command, one great difference is, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6394,Command is directed to a mans own benefit; and Counsell to the benefit
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6395,"of another man. And from this ariseth another difference, that a man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6396,may be obliged to do what he is Commanded; as when he hath covenanted
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6397,"to obey: But he cannot be obliged to do as he is Counselled, because the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6398,"hurt of not following it, is his own; or if he should covenant to follow"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6399,"it, then is the Counsell turned into the nature of a Command. A third"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6400,"difference between them is, that no man can pretend a right to be of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6401,another mans Counsell; because he is not to pretend benefit by it to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6402,"himselfe; but to demand right to Counsell another, argues a will to know"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6403,"his designes, or to gain some other Good to himselfe; which (as I said"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6404,before) is of every mans will the proper object.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6405,"This also is incident to the nature of Counsell; that whatsoever it be,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6406,"he that asketh it, cannot in equity accuse, or punish it: For to ask"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6407,"Counsell of another, is to permit him to give such Counsell as he shall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6408,"think best; And consequently, he that giveth counsell to his Soveraign,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6409,"(whether a Monarch, or an Assembly) when he asketh it, cannot in equity"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6410,"be punished for it, whether the same be conformable to the opinion of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6411,"the most, or not, so it be to the Proposition in debate. For if the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6412,"sense of the Assembly can be taken notice of, before the Debate be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6413,"ended, they should neither ask, nor take any further Counsell; For the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6414,"Sense of the Assembly, is the Resolution of the Debate, and End of all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6415,"Deliberation. And generally he that demandeth Counsell, is Author of it;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6416,"and therefore cannot punish it; and what the Soveraign cannot, no man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6417,"else can. But if one Subject giveth Counsell to another, to do any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6418,"thing contrary to the Lawes, whether that Counsell proceed from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6419,"evill intention, or from ignorance onely, it is punishable by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6420,"Common-wealth; because ignorance of the Law, is no good excuse, where"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6421,every man is bound to take notice of the Lawes to which he is subject.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6422,Exhortation And Dehortation What
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6423,"EXHORTATION, and DEHORTATION, is Counsell, accompanied with signes in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6424,"him that giveth it, of vehement desire to have it followed; or to say it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6425,"more briefly, Counsell Vehemently Pressed. For he that Exhorteth, doth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6426,"not deduce the consequences of what he adviseth to be done, and tye"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6427,himselfe therein to the rigour of true reasoning; but encourages him he
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6428,"Counselleth, to Action: As he that Dehorteth, deterreth him from it. And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6429,"therefore they have in their speeches, a regard to the common Passions,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6430,"and opinions of men, in deducing their reasons; and make use of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6431,"Similitudes, Metaphors, Examples, and other tooles of Oratory, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6432,"perswade their Hearers of the Utility, Honour, or Justice of following"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6433,their advise.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6434,"From whence may be inferred, First, that Exhortation and Dehortation,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6435,"is directed to the Good of him that giveth the Counsell, not of him that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6436,"asketh it, which is contrary to the duty of a Counsellour; who (by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6437,"definition of Counsell) ought to regard, not his own benefits, but his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6438,whom he adviseth. And that he directeth his Counsell to his own
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6439,"benefit, is manifest enough, by the long and vehement urging, or by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6440,"the artificial giving thereof; which being not required of him, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6441,"consequently proceeding from his own occasions, is directed principally"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6442,"to his own benefit, and but accidentarily to the good of him that is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6443,"Counselled, or not at all."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6444,"Secondly, that the use of Exhortation and Dehortation lyeth onely, where"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6445,a man is to speak to a Multitude; because when the Speech is addressed
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6446,"to one, he may interrupt him, and examine his reasons more rigorously,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6447,than can be done in a Multitude; which are too many to enter into
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6448,"Dispute, and Dialogue with him that speaketh indifferently to them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6449,"all at once. Thirdly, that they that Exhort and Dehort, where they are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6450,"required to give Counsell, are corrupt Counsellours, and as it were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6451,bribed by their own interest. For though the Counsell they give be never
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6452,"so good; yet he that gives it, is no more a good Counsellour, than he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6453,"that giveth a Just Sentence for a reward, is a just Judge. But where a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6454,"man may lawfully Command, as a Father in his Family, or a Leader in an"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6455,"Army, his Exhortations and Dehortations, are not onely lawfull, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6456,"also necessary, and laudable: But then they are no more Counsells, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6457,Commands; which when they are for Execution of soure labour; sometimes
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6458,"necessity, and alwayes humanity requireth to be sweetned in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6459,"delivery, by encouragement, and in the tune and phrase of Counsell,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6460,rather then in harsher language of Command.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6461,"Examples of the difference between Command and Counsell, we may take"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6462,"from the formes of Speech that expresse them in Holy Scripture. ""Have no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6463,other Gods but me; Make to thy selfe no graven Image; Take not Gods name
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6464,in vain; Sanctifie the Sabbath; Honour thy Parents; Kill not; Steale
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6465,"not,"" &c. are Commands; because the reason for which we are to obey"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6466,"them, is drawn from the will of God our King, whom we are obliged to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6467,"obey. But these words, ""Sell all thou hast; give it to the poore; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6468,"follow me,"" are Counsell; because the reason for which we are to do"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6469,"so, is drawn from our own benefit; which is this, that we shall have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6470,"""Treasure in Heaven."" These words, ""Go into the village over against"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6471,"you, and you shall find an Asse tyed, and her Colt; loose her, and bring"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6472,"her to me,"" are a Command: for the reason of their fact is drawn from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6473,"the will of their Master: but these words, ""Repent, and be Baptized in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6474,"the Name of Jesus,"" are Counsell; because the reason why we should so"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6475,"do, tendeth not to any benefit of God Almighty, who shall still be King"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6476,"in what manner soever we rebell; but of our selves, who have no other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6477,means of avoyding the punishment hanging over us for our sins.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6478,Differences Of Fit And Unfit Counsellours
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6479,"As the difference of Counsell from Command, hath been now deduced from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6480,"the nature of Counsell, consisting in a deducing of the benefit, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6481,"hurt that may arise to him that is to be Counselled, by the necessary"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6482,or probable consequences of the action he propoundeth; so may also the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6483,"differences between apt, and inept counsellours be derived from the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6484,"same. For Experience, being but Memory of the consequences of like"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6485,"actions formerly observed, and Counsell but the Speech whereby that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6486,"experience is made known to another; the Vertues, and Defects of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6487,"Counsell, are the same with the Vertues, and Defects Intellectuall:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6488,"And to the Person of a Common-wealth, his Counsellours serve him in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6489,"place of Memory, and Mentall Discourse. But with this resemblance of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6490,"Common-wealth, to a naturall man, there is one dissimilitude joyned,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6491,"of great importance; which is, that a naturall man receiveth his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6492,"experience, from the naturall objects of sense, which work upon him"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6493,"without passion, or interest of their own; whereas they that give"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6494,"Counsell to the Representative person of a Common-wealth, may have,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6495,"and have often their particular ends, and passions, that render their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6496,"Counsells alwayes suspected, and many times unfaithfull. And therefore"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6497,"we may set down for the first condition of a good Counsellour, That His"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6498,"Ends, And Interest, Be Not Inconsistent With The Ends And Interest Of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6499,Him He Counselleth.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6500,"Secondly, Because the office of a Counsellour, when an action comes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6501,"into deliberation, is to make manifest the consequences of it, in such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6502,"manner, as he that is Counselled may be truly and evidently informed; he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6503,"ought to propound his advise, in such forme of speech, as may make"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6504,"the truth most evidently appear; that is to say, with as firme"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6505,"ratiocination, as significant and proper language, and as briefly, as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6506,"the evidence will permit. And therefore Rash, And Unevident Inferences;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6507,"(such as are fetched onely from Examples, or authority of Books, and are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6508,"not arguments of what is good, or evill, but witnesses of fact, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6509,"of opinion,) Obscure, Confused, And Ambiguous Expressions, Also All"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6510,"Metaphoricall Speeches, Tending To The Stirring Up Of Passion, (because"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6511,"such reasoning, and such expressions, are usefull onely to deceive, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6512,to lead him we Counsell towards other ends than his own) Are Repugnant
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6513,To The Office Of A Counsellour.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6514,"Thirdly, Because the Ability of Counselling proceedeth from Experience,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6515,and long study; and no man is presumed to have experience in all those
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6516,things that to the Administration of a great Common-wealth are necessary
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6517,"to be known, No Man Is Presumed To Be A Good Counsellour, But In Such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6518,"Businesse, As He Hath Not Onely Been Much Versed In, But Hath Also"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6519,"Much Meditated On, And Considered. For seeing the businesse of a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6520,"Common-wealth is this, to preserve the people at home, and defend them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6521,"against forraign Invasion, we shall find, it requires great knowledge"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6522,"of the disposition of Man-kind, of the Rights of Government, and of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6523,"nature of Equity, Law, Justice, and Honour, not to be attained without"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6524,"study; And of the Strength, Commodities, Places, both of their own"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6525,"Country, and their Neighbours; as also of the inclinations, and designes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6526,"of all Nations that may any way annoy them. And this is not attained to,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6527,"without much experience. Of which things, not onely the whole summe, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6528,"every one of the particulars requires the age, and observation of a man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6529,"in years, and of more than ordinary study. The wit required for Counsel,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6530,as I have said before is Judgement. And the differences of men in that
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6531,"point come from different education, of some to one kind of study, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6532,"businesse, and of others to another. When for the doing of any thing,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6533,"there be Infallible rules, (as in Engines, and Edifices, the rules of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6534,"Geometry,) all the experience of the world cannot equall his Counsell,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6535,"that has learnt, or found out the Rule. And when there is no such Rule,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6536,"he that hath most experience in that particular kind of businesse, has"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6537,"therein the best Judgement, and is the best Counsellour."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6538,"Fourthly, to be able to give Counsell to a Common-wealth, in a businesse"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6539,"that hath reference to another Common-wealth, It Is Necessary To Be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6540,"Acquainted With The Intelligences, And Letters That Come From Thence,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6541,"And With All The Records Of Treaties, And Other Transactions Of State"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6542,"Between Them; which none can doe, but such as the Representative"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6543,"shall think fit. By which we may see, that they who are not called to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6544,"Counsell, can have no good Counsell in such cases to obtrude."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6545,"Fifthly, Supposing the number of Counsellors equall, a man is better"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6546,"Counselled by hearing them apart, then in an Assembly; and that for many"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6547,"causes. First, in hearing them apart, you have the advice of every man;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6548,"but in an Assembly may of them deliver their advise with I, or No, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6549,"with their hands, or feet, not moved by their own sense, but by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6550,"eloquence of another, or for feare of displeasing some that have spoken,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6551,"or the whole Assembly, by contradiction; or for feare of appearing"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6552,"duller in apprehension, than those that have applauded the contrary"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6553,"opinion. Secondly, in an Assembly of many, there cannot choose but be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6554,some whose interests are contrary to that of the Publique; and these
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6555,"their Interests make passionate, and Passion eloquent, and Eloquence"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6556,"drawes others into the same advice. For the Passions of men, which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6557,"asunder are moderate, as the heat of one brand; in Assembly are like"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6558,"many brands, that enflame one another, (especially when they blow one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6559,"another with Orations) to the setting of the Common-wealth on fire,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6560,"under pretence of Counselling it. Thirdly, in hearing every man apart,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6561,"one may examine (when there is need) the truth, or probability of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6562,"his reasons, and of the grounds of the advise he gives, by frequent"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6563,"interruptions, and objections; which cannot be done in an Assembly,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6564,"where (in every difficult question) a man is rather astonied, and dazled"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6565,"with the variety of discourse upon it, than informed of the course he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6566,"ought to take. Besides, there cannot be an Assembly of many, called"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6567,"together for advice, wherein there be not some, that have the ambition"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6568,"to be thought eloquent, and also learned in the Politiques; and give not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6569,"their advice with care of the businesse propounded, but of the applause"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6570,"of their motly orations, made of the divers colored threds, or shreds of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6571,"Authors; which is an Impertinence at least, that takes away the time"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6572,"of serious Consultation, and in the secret way of Counselling apart, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6573,"easily avoided. Fourthly, in Deliberations that ought to be kept secret,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6574,"(whereof there be many occasions in Publique Businesse,) the Counsells"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6575,"of many, and especially in Assemblies, are dangerous; And therefore"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6576,great Assemblies are necessitated to commit such affaires to lesser
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6577,"numbers, and of such persons as are most versed, and in whose fidelity"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6578,they have most confidence.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6579,"To conclude, who is there that so far approves the taking of Counsell"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6580,"from a great Assembly of Counsellours, that wisheth for, or would accept"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6581,"of their pains, when there is a question of marrying his Children,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6582,"disposing of his Lands, governing his Household, or managing his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6583,"private Estate, especially if there be amongst them such as wish not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6584,his prosperity? A man that doth his businesse by the help of many and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6585,"prudent Counsellours, with every one consulting apart in his proper"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6586,"element, does it best, as he that useth able Seconds at Tennis play,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6587,"placed in their proper stations. He does next best, that useth his own"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6588,Judgement only; as he that has no Second at all. But he that is carried
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6589,"up and down to his businesse in a framed Counsell, which cannot move"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6590,"but by the plurality of consenting opinions, the execution whereof is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6591,"commonly (out of envy, or interest) retarded by the part dissenting,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6592,"does it worst of all, and like one that is carried to the ball, though"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6593,"by good Players, yet in a Wheele-barrough, or other frame, heavy of it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6594,"self, and retarded also by the inconcurrent judgements, and endeavours"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6595,"of them that drive it; and so much the more, as they be more that set"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6596,"their hands to it; and most of all, when there is one, or more amongst"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6597,"them, that desire to have him lose. And though it be true, that many eys"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6598,see more then one; yet it is not to be understood of many Counsellours;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6599,"but then only, when the finall Resolution is in one man. Otherwise,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6600,"because many eyes see the same thing in divers lines, and are apt to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6601,look asquint towards their private benefit; they that desire not to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6602,"misse their marke, though they look about with two eyes, yet they never"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6603,ayme but with one; And therefore no great Popular Common-wealth was
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6604,ever kept up; but either by a forraign Enemy that united them; or by
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6605,the reputation of some one eminent Man amongst them; or by the secret
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6606,Counsell of a few; or by the mutuall feare of equall factions; and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6607,not by the open Consultations of the Assembly. And as for very little
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6608,"Common-wealths, be they Popular, or Monarchicall, there is no humane"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6609,"wisdome can uphold them, longer then the Jealousy lasteth of their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,25,6610,potent Neighbours.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6611,CHAPTER XXVI. OF CIVILL LAWES
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6612,Civill Law what
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6613,"By CIVILL LAWES, I understand the Lawes, that men are therefore bound to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6614,"observe, because they are Members, not of this, or that Common-wealth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6615,"in particular, but of a Common-wealth. For the knowledge of particular"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6616,"Lawes belongeth to them, that professe the study of the Lawes of their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6617,"severall Countries; but the knowledge of Civill Law in generall, to any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6618,"man. The antient Law of Rome was called their Civil Law, from the word"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6619,"Civitas, which signifies a Common-wealth; And those Countries, which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6620,"having been under the Roman Empire, and governed by that Law, retaine"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6621,"still such part thereof as they think fit, call that part the Civill"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6622,"Law, to distinguish it from the rest of their own Civill Lawes. But that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6623,is not it I intend to speak of here; my designe being not to shew what
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6624,"is Law here, and there; but what is Law; as Plato, Aristotle, Cicero,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6625,"and divers others have done, without taking upon them the profession of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6626,the study of the Law.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6627,"And first it manifest, that Law in generall, is not Counsell, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6628,"Command; nor a Command of any man to any man; but only of him, whose"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6629,Command is addressed to one formerly obliged to obey him. And as for
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6630,"Civill Law, it addeth only the name of the person Commanding, which is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6631,"Persona Civitatis, the Person of the Common-wealth."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6632,"Which considered, I define Civill Law in this Manner. ""CIVILL LAW, Is to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6633,"every Subject, those Rules, which the Common-wealth hath Commanded him,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6634,"by Word, Writing, or other sufficient Sign of the Will, to make use"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6635,"of, for the Distinction of Right, and Wrong; that is to say, of what is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6636,"contrary, and what is not contrary to the Rule."""
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6637,"In which definition, there is nothing that is not at first sight"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6638,"evident. For every man seeth, that some Lawes are addressed to all the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6639,Subjects in generall; some to particular Provinces; some to particular
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6640,"Vocations; and some to particular Men; and are therefore Lawes, to every"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6641,"of those to whom the Command is directed; and to none else. As also,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6642,"that Lawes are the Rules of Just, and Unjust; nothing being reputed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6643,"Unjust, that is not contrary to some Law. Likewise, that none can"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6644,make Lawes but the Common-wealth; because our Subjection is to the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6645,"Common-wealth only: and that Commands, are to be signified by sufficient"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6646,Signs; because a man knows not otherwise how to obey them. And
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6647,"therefore, whatsoever can from this definition by necessary consequence"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6648,"be deduced, ought to be acknowledged for truth. Now I deduce from it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6649,this that followeth.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6650,The Soveraign Is Legislator
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6651,"1. The Legislator in all Common-wealths, is only the Soveraign, be he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6652,"one Man, as in a Monarchy, or one Assembly of men, as in a Democracy,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6653,"or Aristocracy. For the Legislator, is he that maketh the Law. And the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6654,"Common-wealth only, praescribes, and commandeth the observation of those"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6655,"rules, which we call Law: Therefore the Common-wealth is the Legislator."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6656,"But the Common-wealth is no Person, nor has capacity to doe any thing,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6657,"but by the Representative, (that is, the Soveraign;) and therefore the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6658,"Soveraign is the sole Legislator. For the same reason, none can abrogate"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6659,"a Law made, but the Soveraign; because a Law is not abrogated, but by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6660,"another Law, that forbiddeth it to be put in execution."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6661,And Not Subject To Civill Law
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6662,"2. The Soveraign of a Common-wealth, be it an Assembly, or one Man, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6663,"not subject to the Civill Lawes. For having power to make, and repeale"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6664,"Lawes, he may when he pleaseth, free himselfe from that subjection,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6665,"by repealing those Lawes that trouble him, and making of new; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6666,"consequently he was free before. For he is free, that can be free when"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6667,he will: Nor is it possible for any person to be bound to himselfe;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6668,"because he that can bind, can release; and therefore he that is bound to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6669,"himselfe onely, is not bound."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6670,"Use, A Law Not By Vertue Of Time, But Of The Soveraigns Consent"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6671,"3. When long Use obtaineth the authority of a Law, it is not the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6672,"Length of Time that maketh the Authority, but the Will of the Soveraign"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6673,"signified by his silence, (for Silence is sometimes an argument of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6674,"Consent;) and it is no longer Law, then the Soveraign shall be silent"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6675,therein. And therefore if the Soveraign shall have a question of Right
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6676,"grounded, not upon his present Will, but upon the Lawes formerly"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6677,made; the Length of Time shal bring no prejudice to his Right; but the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6678,"question shal be judged by Equity. For many unjust Actions, and unjust"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6679,"Sentences, go uncontrolled a longer time, than any man can remember."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6680,"And our Lawyers account no Customes Law, but such as are reasonable, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6681,that evill Customes are to be abolished; But the Judgement of what is
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6682,"reasonable, and of what is to be abolished, belongeth to him that maketh"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6683,"the Law, which is the Soveraign Assembly, or Monarch."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6684,"The Law Of Nature, And The Civill Law Contain Each Other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6685,"4. The Law of Nature, and the Civill Law, contain each other, and are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6686,"of equall extent. For the Lawes of Nature, which consist in Equity,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6687,"Justice, Gratitude, and other morall Vertues on these depending, in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6688,condition of meer Nature (as I have said before in the end of the 15th
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6689,"Chapter,) are not properly Lawes, but qualities that dispose men to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6690,"peace, and to obedience. When a Common-wealth is once settled, then are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6691,"they actually Lawes, and not before; as being then the commands of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6692,Common-wealth; and therefore also Civill Lawes: for it is the Soveraign
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6693,Power that obliges men to obey them. For in the differences of private
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6694,"men, to declare, what is Equity, what is Justice, and what is morall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6695,"Vertue, and to make them binding, there is need of the Ordinances of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6696,"Soveraign Power, and Punishments to be ordained for such as shall break"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6697,them; which Ordinances are therefore part of the Civill Law. The Law of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6698,Nature therefore is a part of the Civill Law in all Common-wealths of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6699,"the world. Reciprocally also, the Civill Law is a part of the Dictates"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6700,"of Nature. For Justice, that is to say, Performance of Covenant, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6701,"giving to every man his own, is a Dictate of the Law of Nature. But"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6702,"every subject in a Common-wealth, hath covenanted to obey the Civill"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6703,"Law, (either one with another, as when they assemble to make a common"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6704,"Representative, or with the Representative it selfe one by one, when"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6705,"subdued by the Sword they promise obedience, that they may receive"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6706,life;) And therefore Obedience to the Civill Law is part also of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6707,"Law of Nature. Civill, and Naturall Law are not different kinds, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6708,"different parts of Law; whereof one part being written, is called"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6709,"Civill, the other unwritten, Naturall. But the Right of Nature, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6710,"is, the naturall Liberty of man, may by the Civill Law be abridged,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6711,"and restrained: nay, the end of making Lawes, is no other, but such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6712,Restraint; without the which there cannot possibly be any Peace. And Law
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6713,"was brought into the world for nothing else, but to limit the naturall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6714,"liberty of particular men, in such manner, as they might not hurt, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6715,"assist one another, and joyn together against a common Enemy."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6716,"Provinciall Lawes Are Not Made By Custome, But By The Soveraign Power"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6717,"5. If the Soveraign of one Common-wealth, subdue a people that have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6718,"lived under other written Lawes, and afterwards govern them by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6719,"same Lawes, by which they were governed before; yet those Lawes are the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6720,"Civill Lawes of the Victor, and not of the Vanquished Common-wealth, For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6721,"the Legislator is he, not by whose authority the Lawes were first made,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6722,but by whose authority they now continue to be Lawes. And therefore
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6723,"where there be divers Provinces, within the Dominion of a Common-wealth,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6724,"and in those Provinces diversity of Lawes, which commonly are called the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6725,"Customes of each severall Province, we are not to understand that such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6726,"Customes have their Force, onely from Length of Time; but that they were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6727,"antiently Lawes written, or otherwise made known, for the Constitutions,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6728,"and Statutes of their Soveraigns; and are now Lawes, not by vertue of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6729,"the Praescription of time, but by the Constitutions of their present"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6730,"Soveraigns. But if an unwritten Law, in all the Provinces of a Dominion,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6731,"shall be generally observed, and no iniquity appear in the use thereof;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6732,"that law can be no other but a Law of Nature, equally obliging all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6733,man-kind.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6734,Some Foolish Opinions Of Lawyers Concerning The Making Of Lawes
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6735,"6. Seeing then all Lawes, written, and unwritten, have their Authority,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6736,"and force, from the Will of the Common-wealth; that is to say, from the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6737,"Will of the Representative; which in a Monarchy is the Monarch, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6738,in other Common-wealths the Soveraign Assembly; a man may wonder from
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6739,"whence proceed such opinions, as are found in the Books of Lawyers of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6740,"eminence in severall Common-wealths, directly, or by consequence making"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6741,"the Legislative Power depend on private men, or subordinate Judges."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6742,"As for example, ""That the Common Law, hath no Controuler but the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6743,"Parlament;"" which is true onely where a Parlament has the Soveraign"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6744,"Power, and cannot be assembled, nor dissolved, but by their own"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6745,"discretion. For if there be a right in any else to dissolve them, there"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6746,"is a right also to controule them, and consequently to controule their"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6748,"Lawes is not Parlamentum, but Rex In Parlamento. And where a Parlament"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6749,"is Soveraign, if it should assemble never so many, or so wise men, from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6750,"the Countries subject to them, for whatsoever cause; yet there is no man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6751,"will believe, that such an Assembly hath thereby acquired to themselves"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6752,"a Legislative Power. Item, that the two arms of a Common-wealth,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6753,"are Force, and Justice; The First Whereof Is In The King; The Other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6754,Deposited In The Hands Of The Parlament. As if a Common-wealth could
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6755,"consist, where the Force were in any hand, which Justice had not the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6756,Authority to command and govern.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6757,"7. That Law can never be against Reason, our Lawyers are agreed; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6758,"that not the Letter,(that is, every construction of it,) but that which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6759,"is according to the Intention of the Legislator, is the Law. And it is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6760,"true: but the doubt is, of whose Reason it is, that shall be received"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6761,for Law. It is not meant of any private Reason; for then there would be
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6762,"as much contradiction in the Lawes, as there is in the Schooles; nor yet"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6763,"(as Sr. Ed, Coke makes it (Sir Edward Coke, upon Littleton Lib.2. Ch.6"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6769,"reasons and resolutions are, and must remain discordant: and therefore"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6770,"it is not that Juris Prudentia, or wisedome of subordinate Judges;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6771,"but the Reason of this our Artificiall Man the Common-wealth, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6772,"his Command, that maketh Law: And the Common-wealth being in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6773,"their Representative but one Person, there cannot easily arise any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6774,"contradiction in the Lawes; and when there doth, the same Reason is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6775,"able, by interpretation, or alteration, to take it away. In all Courts"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6776,"of Justice, the Soveraign (which is the Person of the Common-wealth,)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6777,"is he that Judgeth: The subordinate Judge, ought to have regard to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6778,"reason, which moved his Soveraign to make such Law, that his Sentence"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6779,may be according thereunto; which then is his Soveraigns Sentence;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6780,"otherwise it is his own, and an unjust one."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6781,"Law Made, If Not Also Made Known, Is No Law"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6782,"8. From this, that the Law is a Command, and a Command consisteth in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6783,"declaration, or manifestation of the will of him that commandeth, by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6784,"voyce, writing, or some other sufficient argument of the same, we may"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6785,"understand, that the Command of the Common-wealth, is Law onely to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6786,"those, that have means to take notice of it. Over naturall fooles,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6787,"children, or mad-men there is no Law, no more than over brute beasts;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6788,"nor are they capable of the title of just, or unjust; because they had"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6789,"never power to make any covenant, or to understand the consequences"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6790,thereof; and consequently never took upon them to authorise the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6791,"actions of any Soveraign, as they must do that make to themselves a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6792,"Common-wealth. And as those from whom Nature, or Accident hath taken"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6793,"away the notice of all Lawes in generall; so also every man, from whom"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6794,"any accident, not proceeding from his own default, hath taken away the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6795,"means to take notice of any particular Law, is excused, if he observe it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6796,"not; And to speak properly, that Law is no Law to him. It is therefore"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6797,"necessary, to consider in this place, what arguments, and signes be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6798,"sufficient for the knowledge of what is the Law; that is to say, what is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6799,"the will of the Soveraign, as well in Monarchies, as in other formes of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6800,government.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6801,Unwritten Lawes Are All Of Them Lawes Of Nature
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6802,"And first, if it be a Law that obliges all the Subjects without"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6803,"exception, and is not written, nor otherwise published in such places as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6804,"they may take notice thereof, it is a Law of Nature. For whatsoever men"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6805,"are to take knowledge of for Law, not upon other mens words, but every"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6806,"one from his own reason, must be such as is agreeable to the reason of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6807,"all men; which no Law can be, but the Law of Nature. The Lawes of Nature"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6808,"therefore need not any publishing, nor Proclamation; as being contained"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6809,"in this one Sentence, approved by all the world, ""Do not that to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6810,"another, which thou thinkest unreasonable to be done by another to thy"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6812,"Secondly, if it be a Law that obliges only some condition of men, or one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6813,"particular man and be not written, nor published by word, then also it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6814,"is a Law of Nature; and known by the same arguments, and signs,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6815,"that distinguish those in such a condition, from other Subjects. For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6816,"whatsoever Law is not written, or some way published by him that makes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6817,"it Law, can be known no way, but by the reason of him that is to obey"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6818,"it; and is therefore also a Law not only Civill, but Naturall. For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6819,"example, if the Soveraign employ a Publique Minister, without written"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6820,Instructions what to doe; he is obliged to take for Instructions the

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6823,"which being alwaies understood to be Equity, he is bound to it by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6824,"Law of Nature: Or if an Ambassador, he is (in al things not conteined"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6827,"all other Ministers of the Soveraignty, publique and private. All which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6828,Instructions of naturall Reason may be comprehended under one name of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6829,Fidelity; which is a branch of naturall Justice.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6830,"The Law of Nature excepted, it belongeth to the essence of all other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6831,"Lawes, to be made known, to every man that shall be obliged to obey"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6832,"them, either by word, or writing, or some other act, known to proceed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6833,"from the Soveraign Authority. For the will of another, cannot be"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6836,"supposed alwaies consonant to Equity and Reason. And in antient time,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6837,"before letters were in common use, the Lawes were many times put into"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6838,"verse; that the rude people taking pleasure in singing, or reciting"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6839,"them, might the more easily reteine them in memory. And for the same"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6840,"reason Solomon adviseth a man, to bind the ten Commandements (Prov. 7."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6841,3) upon his ten fingers. And for the Law which Moses gave to the people

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6847,Nothing Is Law Where The Legislator Cannot Be Known
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6848,"Nor is it enough the Law be written, and published; but also that there"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6849,"be manifest signs, that it proceedeth from the will of the Soveraign."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6850,"For private men, when they have, or think they have force enough to"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6853,"the Legislative Authority. There is therefore requisite, not only a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6854,"Declaration of the Law, but also sufficient signes of the Author, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6855,"Authority. The Author, or Legislator is supposed in every Common-wealth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6856,"to be evident, because he is the Soveraign, who having been Constituted"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6857,"by the consent of every one, is supposed by every one to be sufficiently"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6858,"known. And though the ignorance, and security of men be such, for the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6859,"most part, as that when the memory of the first Constitution of their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6860,"Common-wealth is worn out, they doe not consider, by whose power they"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6862,"protected, and to be righted when injury is done them; yet because no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6863,"man that considers, can make question of it, no excuse can be derived"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6864,from the ignorance of where the Soveraignty is placed. And it is a
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6865,"Dictate of Naturall Reason, and consequently an evident Law of Nature,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6866,"that no man ought to weaken that power, the protection whereof he hath"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6869,"suggest,) can make any doubt. The difficulty consisteth in the evidence"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6870,"of the Authority derived from him; The removing whereof, dependeth on"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6871,"the knowledge of the publique Registers, publique Counsels, publique"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6881,"that by Commission hath Authority to take cognisance of such causes, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6882,a sufficient Verification of the Law of Nature in that individuall case.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6883,"For though the advice of one that professeth the study of the Law, be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6884,usefull for the avoyding of contention; yet it is but advice; tis the

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6907,very materiall circumstance to make them obligatory. For it is not the

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6911,of all Lawes dependeth on the Authority Soveraign; and the Interpreters

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6922,"self love, or some other passion, it is now become of all Laws the most"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6923,obscure; and has consequently the greatest need of able Interpreters.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6924,"The written Laws, if they be short, are easily mis-interpreted, from the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6925,"divers significations of a word, or two; if long, they be more obscure"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6928,"perfect understanding of the finall causes, for which the Law was"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6929,made; the knowledge of which finall causes is in the Legislator. To him

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6954,"to naturall reason, and Equity; and the Sentence he giveth, is therefore"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6955,the Interpretation of the Law of Nature; which Interpretation is
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6956,Authentique; not because it is his private Sentence; but because
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6957,"he giveth it by Authority of the Soveraign, whereby it becomes the"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6964,"more consonant to Equity to give a contrary Sentence, he is obliged to"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6970,"little circumstance is the same; yet in Lawes immutable, such as are the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6971,"Lawes of Nature, they are no Lawes to the same, or other Judges, in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6972,like cases for ever after. Princes succeed one another; and one Judge
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6973,"passeth, another commeth; nay, Heaven and Earth shall passe; but not one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6974,title of the Law of Nature shall passe; for it is the Eternall Law of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6975,God. Therefore all the Sentences of precedent Judges that have ever
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6976,"been, cannot all together make a Law contrary to naturall Equity: Nor"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6977,"any Examples of former Judges, can warrant an unreasonable Sentence, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6978,discharge the present Judge of the trouble of studying what is Equity
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6979,"(in the case he is to Judge,) from the principles of his own naturall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6980,"reason. For example sake, 'Tis against the Law of Nature, To Punish The"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6981,"Innocent; and Innocent is he that acquitteth himselfe Judicially, and is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6982,"acknowledged for Innocent by the Judge. Put the case now, that a man is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6983,"accused of a capitall crime, and seeing the powers and malice of some"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6984,"enemy, and the frequent corruption and partiality of Judges, runneth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6985,"away for feare of the event, and afterwards is taken, and brought to a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6986,"legall triall, and maketh it sufficiently appear, he was not guilty of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6987,"the crime, and being thereof acquitted, is neverthelesse condemned to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6988,lose his goods; this is a manifest condemnation of the Innocent. I say
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6989,"therefore, that there is no place in the world, where this can be an"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6990,"interpretation of a Law of Nature, or be made a Law by the Sentences of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6991,"precedent Judges, that had done the same. For he that judged it first,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6992,judged unjustly; and no Injustice can be a pattern of Judgement to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6993,"succeeding Judges. A written Law may forbid innocent men to fly, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6994,"they may be punished for flying: But that flying for feare of injury,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6995,"should be taken for presumption of guilt, after a man is already"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6996,"absolved of the crime Judicially, is contrary to the nature of a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6997,"Presumption, which hath no place after Judgement given. Yet this is set"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6998,"down by a great Lawyer for the common Law of England. ""If a man,"" saith"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,6999,"he, ""that is Innocent, be accused of Felony, and for feare flyeth for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7000,the same; albeit he judicially acquitteth himselfe of the Felony; yet
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7001,"if it be found that he fled for the Felony, he shall notwithstanding his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7002,"Innocency, Forfeit all his goods, chattels, debts, and duties. For as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7003,"to the Forfeiture of them, the Law will admit no proofe against the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7004,"Presumption in Law, grounded upon his flight."" Here you see, An Innocent"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7005,"Man, Judicially Acquitted, Notwithstanding His Innocency, (when no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7006,"written Law forbad him to fly) after his acquitall, Upon A Presumption"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7007,"In Law, condemned to lose all the goods he hath. If the Law ground upon"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7008,"his flight a Presumption of the fact, (which was Capitall,) the Sentence"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7009,"ought to have been Capitall: if the presumption were not of the Fact,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7010,for what then ought he to lose his goods? This therefore is no Law of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7011,"England; nor is the condemnation grounded upon a Presumption of Law, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7012,"upon the Presumption of the Judges. It is also against Law, to say"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7013,that no Proofe shall be admitted against a Presumption of Law. For
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7014,"all Judges, Soveraign and subordinate, if they refuse to heare Proofe,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7015,"refuse to do Justice: for though the Sentence be Just, yet the Judges"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7016,"that condemn without hearing the Proofes offered, are Unjust Judges; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7017,their Presumption is but Prejudice; which no man ought to bring with him
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7018,"to the Seat of Justice, whatsoever precedent judgements, or examples he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7019,"shall pretend to follow. There be other things of this nature, wherein"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7020,"mens Judgements have been perverted, by trusting to Precedents: but this"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7021,"is enough to shew, that though the Sentence of the Judge, be a Law to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7022,"the party pleading, yet it is no Law to any Judge, that shall succeed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7023,him in that Office.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7024,"In like manner, when question is of the Meaning of written Lawes, he is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7025,"not the Interpreter of them, that writeth a Commentary upon them. For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7026,"Commentaries are commonly more subject to cavill, than the Text; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7027,therefore need other Commentaries; and so there will be no end of such
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7028,Interpretation. And therefore unlesse there be an Interpreter authorised
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7029,"by the Soveraign, from which the subordinate Judges are not to recede,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7030,"the Interpreter can be no other than the ordinary Judges, in the some"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7031,"manner, as they are in cases of the unwritten Law; and their Sentences"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7032,"are to be taken by them that plead, for Lawes in that particular case;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7033,"but not to bind other Judges, in like cases to give like judgements."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7034,For a Judge may erre in the Interpretation even of written Lawes; but no
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7035,"errour of a subordinate Judge, can change the Law, which is the generall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7036,Sentence of the Soveraigne.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7037,The Difference Between The Letter And Sentence Of The Law
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7038,"In written Lawes, men use to make a difference between the Letter, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7039,"the Sentence of the Law: And when by the Letter, is meant whatsoever"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7040,"can be gathered from the bare words, 'tis well distinguished. For the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7041,"significations of almost all words, are either in themselves, or in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7042,"metaphoricall use of them, ambiguous; and may be drawn in argument, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7043,make many senses; but there is onely one sense of the Law. But if by the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7044,"Letter, be meant the Literall sense, then the Letter, and the Sentence"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7045,"or intention of the Law, is all one. For the literall sense is that,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7046,which the Legislator is alwayes supposed to be Equity: For it were a
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7047,great contumely for a Judge to think otherwise of the Soveraigne.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7048,"He ought therefore, if the Word of the Law doe not fully authorise a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7049,"reasonable Sentence, to supply it with the Law of Nature; or if the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7050,"case be difficult, to respit Judgement till he have received more ample"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7051,"authority. For Example, a written Law ordaineth, that he which is thrust"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7052,"out of his house by force, shall be restored by force: It happens that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7053,"a man by negligence leaves his house empty, and returning is kept out by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7054,"force, in which case there is no speciall Law ordained. It is evident,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7055,that this case is contained in the same Law: for else there is no remedy
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7056,for him at all; which is to be supposed against the Intention of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7057,"Legislator. Again, the word of the Law, commandeth to Judge according"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7058,"to the Evidence: A man is accused falsly of a fact, which the Judge saw"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7059,himself done by another; and not by him that is accused. In this case
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7060,neither shall the Letter of the Law be followed to the condemnation of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7061,"the Innocent, nor shall the Judge give Sentence against the evidence"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7062,of the Witnesses; because the Letter of the Law is to the contrary:
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7063,"but procure of the Soveraign that another be made Judge, and himselfe"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7064,Witnesse. So that the incommodity that follows the bare words of a
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7065,"written Law, may lead him to the Intention of the Law, whereby to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7066,interpret the same the better; though no Incommodity can warrant a
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7067,"Sentence against the Law. For every Judge of Right, and Wrong, is not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7068,"Judge of what is Commodious, or Incommodious to the Common-wealth."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7069,The Abilities Required In A Judge
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7070,"The abilities required in a good Interpreter of the Law, that is to say,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7071,"in a good Judge, are not the same with those of an Advocate; namely the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7072,"study of the Lawes. For a Judge, as he ought to take notice of the Fact,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7073,from none but the Witnesses; so also he ought to take notice of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7074,"Law, from nothing but the Statutes, and Constitutions of the Soveraign,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7075,"alledged in the pleading, or declared to him by some that have authority"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7076,from the Soveraign Power to declare them; and need not take care
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7077,"before-hand, what hee shall Judge; for it shall bee given him what hee"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7078,"shall say concerning the Fact, by Witnesses; and what hee shall say in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7079,"point of Law, from those that shall in their pleadings shew it, and by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7080,authority interpret it upon the place. The Lords of Parlament in England
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7081,"were Judges, and most difficult causes have been heard and determined"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7082,"by them; yet few of them were much versed in the study of the Lawes,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7083,and fewer had made profession of them: and though they consulted with
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7084,"Lawyers, that were appointed to be present there for that purpose; yet"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7085,"they alone had the authority of giving Sentence. In like manner, in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7086,"the ordinary trialls of Right, Twelve men of the common People, are the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7087,"Judges, and give Sentence, not onely of the Fact, but of the Right; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7088,"pronounce simply for the Complaynant, or for the Defendant; that is to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7089,"say, are Judges not onely of the Fact, but also of the Right: and in a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7090,"question of crime, not onely determine whether done, or not done; but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7091,"also whether it be Murder, Homicide, Felony, Assault, and the like,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7092,which are determinations of Law: but because they are not supposed to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7093,"know the Law of themselves, there is one that hath Authority to enforme"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7094,"them of it, in the particular case they are to Judge of. But yet if they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7095,"judge not according to that he tells them, they are not subject thereby"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7096,"to any penalty; unlesse it be made appear, they did it against their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7097,"consciences, or had been corrupted by reward. The things that make"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7098,"a good Judge, or good Interpreter of the Lawes, are, first A Right"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7099,Understanding of that principall Law of Nature called Equity; which
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7100,"depending not on the reading of other mens Writings, but on the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7101,"goodnesse of a mans own naturall Reason, and Meditation, is presumed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7102,"to be in those most, that have had most leisure, and had the most"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7103,"inclination to meditate thereon. Secondly, Contempt Of Unnecessary"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7104,"Riches, and Preferments. Thirdly, To Be Able In Judgement To Devest"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7105,"Himselfe Of All Feare, Anger, Hatred, Love, And Compassion. Fourthly,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7106,"and lastly, Patience To Heare; Diligent Attention In Hearing; And Memory"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7107,"To Retain, Digest And Apply What He Hath Heard."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7108,Divisions Of Law
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7109,"The difference and division of the Lawes, has been made in divers"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7110,"manners, according to the different methods, of those men that have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7111,"written of them. For it is a thing that dependeth not on Nature, but on"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7112,the scope of the Writer; and is subservient to every mans proper method.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7113,"In the Institutions of Justinian, we find seven sorts of Civill Lawes."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7114,"1. The Edicts, Constitutions, and Epistles Of The Prince, that is, of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7115,the Emperour; because the whole power of the people was in him. Like
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7116,"these, are the Proclamations of the Kings of England."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7117,"2. The Decrees Of The Whole People Of Rome (comprehending the Senate,)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7118,"when they were put to the Question by the Senate. These were Lawes, at"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7119,"first, by the vertue of the Soveraign Power residing in the people; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7120,"such of them as by the Emperours were not abrogated, remained Lawes by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7121,"the Authority Imperiall. For all Lawes that bind, are understood to be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7122,Lawes by his authority that has power to repeale them. Somewhat like to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7123,"these Lawes, are the Acts of Parliament in England."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7124,"3. The Decrees Of The Common People (excluding the Senate,) when they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7125,were put to the question by the Tribune of the people. For such of them
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7126,"as were not abrogated by the Emperours, remained Lawes by the Authority"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7127,"Imperiall. Like to these, were the Orders of the House of Commons in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7128,England.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7129,"4. Senatus Consulta, the Orders Of The Senate; because when the people"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7130,"of Rome grew so numerous, as it was inconvenient to assemble them; it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7131,"was thought fit by the Emperour, that men should Consult the Senate in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7132,stead of the people: And these have some resemblance with the Acts of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7133,Counsell.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7134,"5. The Edicts Of Praetors, and (in some Cases) of the Aediles: such as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7135,are the Chiefe Justices in the Courts of England.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7136,"6. Responsa Prudentum; which were the Sentences, and Opinions of those"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7137,"Lawyers, to whom the Emperour gave Authority to interpret the Law, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7138,to give answer to such as in matter of Law demanded their advice;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7139,"which Answers, the Judges in giving Judgement were obliged by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7140,Constitutions of the Emperour to observe; And should be like the Reports
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7141,"of Cases Judged, if other Judges be by the Law of England bound to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7142,"observe them. For the Judges of the Common Law of England, are not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7143,"properly Judges, but Juris Consulti; of whom the Judges, who are either"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7144,"the Lords, or Twelve men of the Country, are in point of Law to ask"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7145,advice.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7146,"7. Also, Unwritten Customes, (which in their own nature are an imitation"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7147,"of Law,) by the tacite consent of the Emperour, in case they be not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7148,"contrary to the Law of Nature, are very Lawes."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7149,"Another division of Lawes, is into Naturall and Positive. Naturall are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7150,those which have been Lawes from all Eternity; and are called not onely
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7151,"Naturall, but also Morall Lawes; consisting in the Morall Vertues, as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7152,"Justice, Equity, and all habits of the mind that conduce to Peace, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7153,Charity; of which I have already spoken in the fourteenth and fifteenth
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7154,Chapters.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7155,"Positive, are those which have not been for Eternity; but have been"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7156,made Lawes by the Will of those that have had the Soveraign Power over
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7157,"others; and are either written, or made known to men, by some other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7158,argument of the Will of their Legislator.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7159,Another Division Of Law
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7160,"Again, of Positive Lawes some are Humane, some Divine; And of Humane"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7161,"positive lawes, some are Distributive, some Penal. Distributive are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7162,"those that determine the Rights of the Subjects, declaring to every man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7163,"what it is, by which he acquireth and holdeth a propriety in lands,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7164,"or goods, and a right or liberty of action; and these speak to all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7165,"the Subjects. Penal are those, which declare, what Penalty shall be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7166,inflicted on those that violate the Law; and speak to the Ministers
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7167,and Officers ordained for execution. For though every one ought to be
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7168,informed of the Punishments ordained beforehand for their transgression;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7169,"neverthelesse the Command is not addressed to the Delinquent, (who"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7170,"cannot be supposed will faithfully punish himselfe,) but to publique"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7171,Ministers appointed to see the Penalty executed. And these Penal Lawes
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7172,are for the most part written together with the Lawes Distributive; and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7173,"are sometimes called Judgements. For all Lawes are generall judgements,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7174,"or Sentences of the Legislator; as also every particular Judgement, is a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7175,"Law to him, whose case is Judged."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7176,Divine Positive Law How Made Known To Be Law
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7177,"Divine Positive Lawes (for Naturall Lawes being Eternall, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7178,"Universall, are all Divine,) are those, which being the Commandements of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7179,"God, (not from all Eternity, nor universally addressed to all men, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7180,"onely to a certain people, or to certain persons,) are declared for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7181,"such, by those whom God hath authorised to declare them. But this"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7182,"Authority of man to declare what be these Positive Lawes of God, how can"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7183,"it be known? God may command a man by a supernaturall way, to deliver"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7184,"Lawes to other men. But because it is of the essence of Law, that he who"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7185,"is to be obliged, be assured of the Authority of him that declareth"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7190,"a Revelation particularly to himselfe, it is evidently impossible:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7191,"for though a man may be induced to believe such Revelation, from the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7192,"Miracles they see him doe, or from seeing the Extraordinary sanctity of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7193,"his life, or from seeing the Extraordinary wisedome, or Extraordinary"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7194,"felicity of his Actions, all which are marks of Gods extraordinary"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7195,favour; yet they are not assured evidence of speciall Revelation.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7196,"Miracles are Marvellous workes: but that which is marvellous to one,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7197,may not be so to another. Sanctity may be feigned; and the visible
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7198,"felicities of this world, are most often the work of God by Naturall,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7199,and ordinary causes. And therefore no man can infallibly know by
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7200,"naturall reason, that another has had a supernaturall revelation of Gods"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7201,will; but only a beliefe; every one (as the signs thereof shall appear
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7202,"greater, or lesser) a firmer, or a weaker belief."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7203,"But for the second, how he can be bound to obey them; it is not so hard."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7204,"For if the Law declared, be not against the Law of Nature (which is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7205,"undoubtedly Gods Law) and he undertake to obey it, he is bound by his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7206,"own act; bound I say to obey it, but not bound to believe it: for mens"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7207,"beliefe, and interiour cogitations, are not subject to the commands,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7208,"but only to the operation of God, ordinary, or extraordinary. Faith of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7209,"Supernaturall Law, is not a fulfilling, but only an assenting to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7210,"same; and not a duty that we exhibite to God, but a gift which God"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7211,freely giveth to whom he pleaseth; as also Unbelief is not a breach
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7212,"of any of his Lawes; but a rejection of them all, except the Lawes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7213,"Naturall. But this that I say, will be made yet cleerer, by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7214,"Examples, and Testimonies concerning this point in holy Scripture. The"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7215,"Covenant God made with Abraham (in a Supernaturall Manner) was thus,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7216,"(Gen. 17. 10) ""This is the Covenant which thou shalt observe between"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7217,"Me and Thee and thy Seed after thee."" Abrahams Seed had not this"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7218,"revelation, nor were yet in being; yet they are a party to the Covenant,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7219,and bound to obey what Abraham should declare to them for Gods Law;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7220,"which they could not be, but in vertue of the obedience they owed to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7221,"their Parents; who (if they be Subject to no other earthly power, as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7222,"here in the case of Abraham) have Soveraign power over their children,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7223,"and servants. Againe, where God saith to Abraham, ""In thee shall all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7224,Nations of the earth be blessed: For I know thou wilt command thy
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7225,"children, and thy house after thee to keep the way of the Lord, and to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7226,"observe Righteousnesse and Judgement,"" it is manifest, the obedience of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7227,"his Family, who had no Revelation, depended on their former obligation"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7228,to obey their Soveraign. At Mount Sinai Moses only went up to God; the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7229,people were forbidden to approach on paine of death; yet were they bound
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7230,"to obey all that Moses declared to them for Gods Law. Upon what ground,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7231,"but on this submission of their own, ""Speak thou to us, and we will"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7232,"heare thee; but let not God speak to us, lest we dye?"" By which two"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7233,"places it sufficiently appeareth, that in a Common-wealth, a subject"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7234,that has no certain and assured Revelation particularly to himself
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7235,"concerning the Will of God, is to obey for such, the Command of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7236,"the Common-wealth: for if men were at liberty, to take for Gods"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7237,"Commandements, their own dreams, and fancies, or the dreams and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7238,fancies of private men; scarce two men would agree upon what is Gods
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7239,"Commandement; and yet in respect of them, every man would despise the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7240,"Commandements of the Common-wealth. I conclude therefore, that in all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7241,"things not contrary to the Morall Law, (that is to say, to the Law of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7242,"Nature,) all Subjects are bound to obey that for divine Law, which is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7243,"declared to be so, by the Lawes of the Common-wealth. Which also is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7244,evident to any mans reason; for whatsoever is not against the Law of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7245,"Nature, may be made Law in the name of them that have the Soveraign"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7246,"power; and there is no reason men should be the lesse obliged by it,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7247,"when tis propounded in the name of God. Besides, there is no place in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7248,"the world where men are permitted to pretend other Commandements of God,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7249,than are declared for such by the Common-wealth. Christian States punish
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7250,"those that revolt from Christian Religion, and all other States, those"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7251,that set up any Religion by them forbidden. For in whatsoever is not
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7252,"regulated by the Common-wealth, tis Equity (which is the Law of Nature,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7253,and therefore an eternall Law of God) that every man equally enjoy his
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7254,liberty.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7255,Another Division Of Lawes
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7256,"There is also another distinction of Laws, into Fundamentall, and Not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7257,"Fundamentall: but I could never see in any Author, what a Fundamentall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7258,Law signifieth. Neverthelesse one may very reasonably distinguish Laws
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7259,in that manner.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7260,A Fundamentall Law What
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7261,"For a Fundamentall Law in every Common-wealth is that, which being taken"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7262,"away, the Common-wealth faileth, and is utterly dissolved; as a building"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7263,"whose Foundation is destroyed. And therefore a Fundamentall Law is that,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7264,by which Subjects are bound to uphold whatsoever power is given to the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7265,"Soveraign, whether a Monarch, or a Soveraign Assembly, without which the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7266,"Common-wealth cannot stand, such as is the power of War and Peace, of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7267,"Judicature, of Election of Officers, and of doing whatsoever he shall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7268,think necessary for the Publique good. Not Fundamentall is that
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7269,"the abrogating whereof, draweth not with it the dissolution of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7270,Common-Wealth; such as are the Lawes Concerning Controversies between
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7271,subject and subject. Thus much of the Division of Lawes.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7272,Difference Between Law And Right
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7273,"I find the words Lex Civilis, and Jus Civile, that is to say, Law and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7274,"Right Civil, promiscuously used for the same thing, even in the most"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7275,learned Authors; which neverthelesse ought not to be so. For Right is
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7276,"Liberty, namely that Liberty which the Civil Law leaves us: But Civill"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7277,Law is an Obligation; and takes from us the Liberty which the Law of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7278,Nature gave us. Nature gave a Right to every man to secure himselfe
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7279,"by his own strength, and to invade a suspected neighbour, by way of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7280,"prevention; but the Civill Law takes away that Liberty, in all cases"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7281,where the protection of the Lawe may be safely stayd for. Insomuch as
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7282,"Lex and Jus, are as different as Obligation and Liberty."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7283,And Between A Law And A Charter
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7284,Likewise Lawes and Charters are taken promiscuously for the same
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7285,"thing. Yet Charters are Donations of the Soveraign; and not Lawes, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7286,"exemptions from Law. The phrase of a Law is Jubeo, Injungo, I Command,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7287,"and Enjoyn: the phrase of a Charter is Dedi, Concessi, I Have Given, I"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7288,"Have Granted: but what is given or granted, to a man, is not forced"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7289,"upon him, by a Law. A Law may be made to bind All the Subjects of a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7290,"Common-wealth: a Liberty, or Charter is only to One man, or some One"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7291,"part of the people. For to say all the people of a Common-wealth, have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7292,"Liberty in any case whatsoever; is to say, that in such case, there hath"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,26,7293,"been no Law made; or else having been made, is now abrogated."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7294,"CHAPTER XXVII. OF CRIMES, EXCUSES, AND EXTENUATIONS"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7295,Sinne What
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7296,"A Sinne, is not onely a Transgression of a Law, but also any Contempt of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7297,"the Legislator. For such Contempt, is a breach of all his Lawes at once."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7298,"And therefore may consist, not onely in the Commission of a Fact, or in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7299,"the Speaking of Words by the Lawes forbidden, or in the Omission of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7300,"what the Law commandeth, but also in the Intention, or purpose to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7301,"transgresse. For the purpose to breake the Law, is some degree of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7302,"Contempt of him, to whom it belongeth to see it executed. To be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7303,"delighted in the Imagination onely, of being possessed of another mans"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7304,"goods, servants, or wife, without any intention to take them from him"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7305,"by force, or fraud, is no breach of the Law, that sayth, ""Thou shalt not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7306,"covet:"" nor is the pleasure a man my have in imagining, or dreaming of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7307,"the death of him, from whose life he expecteth nothing but dammage, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7308,"displeasure, a Sinne; but the resolving to put some Act in execution,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7309,"that tendeth thereto. For to be pleased in the fiction of that, which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7310,"would please a man if it were reall, is a Passion so adhaerent to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7311,"Nature both of a man, and every other living creature, as to make it a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7312,"Sinne, were to make Sinne of being a man. The consideration of this,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7313,"has made me think them too severe, both to themselves, and others, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7314,"maintain, that the First motions of the mind, (though checked with the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7315,"fear of God) be Sinnes. But I confesse it is safer to erre on that hand,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7316,than on the other.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7317,A Crime What
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7318,"A Crime, is a sinne, consisting in the Committing (by Deed, or Word)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7319,"of that which the Law forbiddeth, or the Omission of what it hath"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7320,commanded. So that every Crime is a sinne; but not every sinne a Crime.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7321,"To intend to steale, or kill, is a sinne, though it never appeare in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7322,"Word, or Fact: for God that seeth the thoughts of man, can lay it to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7323,"his charge: but till it appear by some thing done, or said, by which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7324,the intention may be Crime; which distinction the Greeks observed in
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7325,"the word amartema, and egklema, or aitia; wherof the former, (which is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7326,"translated Sinne,) signifieth any swarving from the Law whatsoever; but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7327,"the two later, (which are translated Crime,) signifie that sinne onely,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7328,"whereof one man may accuse another. But of Intentions, which never"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7329,"appear by any outward act, there is no place for humane accusation. In"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7330,"like manner the Latines by Peccatum, which is Sinne, signifie all manner"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7331,"of deviation from the Law; but by crimen, (which word they derive from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7332,"Cerno, which signifies to perceive,) they mean onely such sinnes, as my"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7333,be made appear before a Judge; and therfore are not meer Intentions.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7334,"Where No Civill Law Is, There Is No Crime"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7335,"From this relation of Sinne to the Law, and of Crime to the Civill"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7336,"Law, may be inferred, First, that where Law ceaseth, Sinne ceaseth."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7337,"But because the Law of Nature is eternall, Violation of Covenants,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7338,"Ingratitude, Arrogance, and all Facts contrary to any Morall vertue, can"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7339,"never cease to be Sinne. Secondly, that the Civill Law ceasing, Crimes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7340,"cease: for there being no other Law remaining, but that of Nature, there"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7341,"is no place for Accusation; every man being his own Judge, and accused"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7342,"onely by his own Conscience, and cleared by the Uprightnesse of his own"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7343,"Intention. When therefore his Intention is Right, his fact is no Sinne:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7344,"if otherwise, his fact is Sinne; but not Crime. Thirdly, That when the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7345,"Soveraign Power ceaseth, Crime also ceaseth: for where there is no such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7346,"Power, there is no protection to be had from the Law; and therefore"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7347,every one may protect himself by his own power: for no man in the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7348,Institution of Soveraign Power can be supposed to give away the Right
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7349,of preserving his own body; for the safety whereof all Soveraignty was
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7350,"ordained. But this is to be understood onely of those, that have not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7351,themselves contributed to the taking away of the Power that protected
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7352,them: for that was a Crime from the beginning.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7353,Ignorance Of The Law Of Nature Excuseth No Man
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7354,"The source of every Crime, is some defect of the Understanding; or some"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7355,"errour in Reasoning, or some sudden force of the Passions. Defect in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7356,"the Understanding, is Ignorance; in Reasoning, Erroneous Opinion. Again,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7357,"ignorance is of three sort; of the Law, and of the Soveraign, and of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7358,Penalty. Ignorance of the Law of Nature Excuseth no man; because every
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7359,"man that hath attained to the use of Reason, is supposed to know, he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7360,"ought not to do to another, what he would not have done to himselfe."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7361,"Therefore into what place soever a man shall come, if he do any thing"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7362,"contrary to that Law, it is a Crime. If a man come from the Indies"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7363,"hither, and perswade men here to receive a new Religion, or teach them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7364,"any thing that tendeth to disobedience of the Lawes of this Country,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7365,"though he be never so well perswaded of the truth of what he teacheth,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7366,"he commits a Crime, and may be justly punished for the same, not onely"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7367,"because his doctrine is false, but also because he does that which he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7368,"would not approve in another, namely, that comming from hence, he should"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7369,"endeavour to alter the Religion there. But ignorance of the Civill Law,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7370,"shall Excuse a man in a strange Country, till it be declared to him;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7371,"because, till then no Civill Law is binding."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7372,Ignorance Of The Civill Law Excuseth Sometimes
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7373,"In the like manner, if the Civill Law of a mans own Country, be not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7374,"so sufficiently declared, as he may know it if he will; nor the Action"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7375,against the Law of Nature; the Ignorance is a good Excuse: In other
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7376,"cases ignorance of the Civill Law, Excuseth not."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7377,Ignorance Of The Soveraign Excuseth Not
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7378,"Ignorance of the Soveraign Power, in the place of a mans ordinary"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7379,"residence, Excuseth him not; because he ought to take notice of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7380,"Power, by which he hath been protected there."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7381,Ignorance Of The Penalty Excuseth Not
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7382,"Ignorance of the Penalty, where the Law is declared, Excuseth no man:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7383,"For in breaking the Law, which without a fear of penalty to follow, were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7384,"not a Law, but vain words, he undergoeth the penalty, though he know not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7385,"what it is; because, whosoever voluntarily doth any action, accepteth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7386,all the known consequences of it; but Punishment is a known consequence
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7387,"of the violation of the Lawes, in every Common-wealth; which punishment,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7388,"if it be determined already by the Law, he is subject to that; if not,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7389,"then is he subject to Arbitrary punishment. For it is reason, that he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7390,"which does Injury, without other limitation than that of his own Will,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7391,"should suffer punishment without other limitation, than that of his Will"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7392,whose Law is thereby violated.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7393,"Punishments Declared Before The Fact, Excuse From Greater Punishments"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7394,After It
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7395,"But when a penalty, is either annexed to the Crime in the Law it selfe,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7396,or hath been usually inflicted in the like cases; there the Delinquent
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7397,"is Excused from a greater penalty. For the punishment foreknown, if not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7398,"great enough to deterre men from the action, is an invitement to it:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7399,"because when men compare the benefit of their Injustice, with the harm"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7400,"of their punishment, by necessity of Nature they choose that which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7401,appeareth best for themselves; and therefore when they are punished more
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7402,"than the Law had formerly determined, or more than others were punished"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7403,"for the same Crime; it the Law that tempted, and deceiveth them."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7404,Nothing Can Be Made A Crime By A Law Made After The Fact
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7405,"No Law, made after a Fact done, can make it a Crime: because if the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7406,"Fact be against the Law of Nature, the Law was before the Fact; and a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7407,"Positive Law cannot be taken notice of, before it be made; and therefore"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7408,"cannot be Obligatory. But when the Law that forbiddeth a Fact, is made"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7409,"before the Fact be done; yet he that doth the Fact, is lyable to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7410,"Penalty ordained after, in case no lesser Penalty were made known"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7413,False Principles Of Right And Wrong Causes Of Crime
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7414,"From defect in Reasoning, (that is to say, from Errour,) men are prone"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7415,"to violate the Lawes, three wayes. First, by Presumption of false"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7416,"Principles; as when men from having observed how in all places, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7417,"in all ages, unjust Actions have been authorised, by the force, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7418,"victories of those who have committed them; and that potent men,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7419,"breaking through the Cob-web Lawes of their Country, the weaker sort,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7420,"and those that have failed in their Enterprises, have been esteemed the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7421,"onely Criminals; have thereupon taken for Principles, and grounds of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7422,"their Reasoning, ""That Justice is but a vain word: That whatsoever a man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7423,"can get by his own Industry, and hazard, is his own: That the Practice"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7424,of all Nations cannot be unjust: That examples of former times are good
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7425,"Arguments of doing the like again;"" and many more of that kind: Which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7426,"being granted, no Act in it selfe can be a Crime, but must be made so"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7427,"(not by the Law, but) by the successe of them that commit it; and the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7428,"same Fact be vertuous, or vicious, as Fortune pleaseth; so that what"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7429,"Marius makes a Crime, Sylla shall make meritorious, and Caesar (the same"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7430,"Lawes standing) turn again into a Crime, to the perpetuall disturbance"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7431,of the Peace of the Common-wealth.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7432,"False Teachers Mis-interpreting The Law Of Nature Secondly, by false"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7433,"Teachers, that either mis-interpret the Law of Nature, making it thereby"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7434,"repugnant to the Law Civill; or by teaching for Lawes, such Doctrines of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7435,"their own, or Traditions of former times, as are inconsistent with the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7436,duty of a Subject.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7437,"And False Inferences From True Principles, By Teachers"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7438,"Thirdly, by Erroneous Inferences from True Principles; which happens"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7439,"commonly to men that are hasty, and praecipitate in concluding, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7440,"resolving what to do; such as are they, that have both a great opinion"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7441,"of their own understanding, and believe that things of this nature"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7442,"require not time and study, but onely common experience, and a good"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7443,naturall wit; whereof no man thinks himselfe unprovided: whereas the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7444,"knowledge, of Right and Wrong, which is no lesse difficult, there is no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7445,"man will pretend to, without great and long study. And of those defects"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7446,"in Reasoning, there is none that can Excuse (though some of them may"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7447,"Extenuate) a Crime, in any man, that pretendeth to the administration of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7448,his own private businesse; much lesse in them that undertake a publique
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7449,"charge; because they pretend to the Reason, upon the want whereof they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7450,would ground their Excuse.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7451,By Their Passions;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7452,"Of the Passions that most frequently are the causes of Crime, one,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7453,"is Vain-glory, or a foolish over-rating of their own worth; as if"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7454,"difference of worth, were an effect of their wit, or riches, or bloud,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7455,"or some other naturall quality, not depending on the Will of those that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7456,have the Soveraign Authority. From whence proceedeth a Presumption that
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7457,"the punishments ordained by the Lawes, and extended generally to all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7458,"Subjects, ought not to be inflicted on them, with the same rigour they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7459,"are inflicted on poore, obscure, and simple men, comprehended under the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7460,name of the Vulgar.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7461,Presumption Of Riches
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7462,"Therefore it happeneth commonly, that such as value themselves by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7463,"greatnesse of their wealth, adventure on Crimes, upon hope of escaping"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7464,"punishment, by corrupting publique Justice, or obtaining Pardon by Mony,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7465,or other rewards.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7466,And Friends
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7467,"And that such as have multitude of Potent Kindred; and popular men, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7468,"have gained reputation amongst the Multitude, take courage to violate"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7469,"the Lawes, from a hope of oppressing the Power, to whom it belongeth to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7470,put them in execution.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7471,Wisedome
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7472,"And that such as have a great, and false opinion of their own Wisedome,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7473,"take upon them to reprehend the actions, and call in question the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7474,"Authority of them that govern, and so to unsettle the Lawes with their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7475,"publique discourse, as that nothing shall be a Crime, but what their own"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7476,"designes require should be so. It happeneth also to the same men, to be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7477,"prone to all such Crimes, as consist in Craft, and in deceiving of their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7478,Neighbours; because they think their designes are too subtile to be
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7479,perceived. These I say are effects of a false presumption of their own
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7480,Wisdome. For of them that are the first movers in the disturbance of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7481,"Common-wealth, (which can never happen without a Civill Warre,) very few"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7482,"are left alive long enough, to see their new Designes established: so"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7483,"that the benefit of their Crimes, redoundeth to Posterity, and such as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7484,"would least have wished it: which argues they were not as wise, as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7485,they thought they were. And those that deceive upon hope of not being
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7486,"observed, do commonly deceive themselves, (the darknesse in which they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7487,"believe they lye hidden, being nothing else but their own blindnesse;)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7488,"and are no wiser than Children, that think all hid, by hiding their own"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7489,eyes.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7490,"And generally all vain-glorious men, (unlesse they be withall timorous,)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7491,are subject to Anger; as being more prone than others to interpret for
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7492,"contempt, the ordinary liberty of conversation: And there are few Crimes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7493,that may not be produced by Anger.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7494,"Hatred, Lust, Ambition, Covetousnesse, Causes Of Crime"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7495,"As for the Passions, of Hate, Lust, Ambition, and Covetousnesse, what"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7496,"Crimes they are apt to produce, is so obvious to every mans experience"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7497,"and understanding, as there needeth nothing to be said of them, saving"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7498,"that they are infirmities, so annexed to the nature, both of man, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7499,"all other living creatures, as that their effects cannot be hindred,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7500,"but by extraordinary use of Reason, or a constant severity in punishing"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7501,"them. For in those things men hate, they find a continuall, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7502,unavoydable molestation; whereby either a mans patience must be
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7503,"everlasting, or he must be eased by removing the power of that which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7504,molesteth him; The former is difficult; the later is many times
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7505,"impossible, without some violation of the Law. Ambition, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7506,"Covetousnesse are Passions also that are perpetually incumbent, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7507,"pressing; whereas Reason is not perpetually present, to resist them:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7508,"and therefore whensoever the hope of impunity appears, their effects"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7509,"proceed. And for Lust, what it wants in the lasting, it hath in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7510,"vehemence, which sufficeth to weigh down the apprehension of all easie,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7511,or uncertain punishments.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7512,"Fear Sometimes Cause Of Crime, As When The Danger Is Neither Present,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7513,Nor Corporeall
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7514,"Of all Passions, that which enclineth men least to break the Lawes, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7515,"Fear. Nay, (excepting some generous natures,) it is the onely thing,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7516,"(when there is apparence of profit, or pleasure by breaking the Lawes,)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7517,that makes men keep them. And yet in many cases a Crime may be committed
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7518,through Feare.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7519,"For not every Fear justifies the Action it produceth, but the fear onely"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7520,"of corporeall hurt, which we call Bodily Fear, and from which a man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7521,"cannot see how to be delivered, but by the action. A man is assaulted,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7522,"fears present death, from which he sees not how to escape, but by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7523,"wounding him that assaulteth him; If he wound him to death, this is no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7524,"Crime; because no man is supposed at the making of a Common-wealth, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7525,"have abandoned the defence of his life, or limbes, where the Law cannot"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7526,"arrive time enough to his assistance. But to kill a man, because from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7527,"his actions, or his threatnings, I may argue he will kill me when he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7528,"can, (seeing I have time, and means to demand protection, from the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7529,"Soveraign Power,) is a Crime. Again, a man receives words of disgrace,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7530,"or some little injuries (for which they that made the Lawes, had"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7531,"assigned no punishment, nor thought it worthy of a man that hath the use"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7532,"of Reason, to take notice of,) and is afraid, unlesse he revenge it,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7533,"he shall fall into contempt, and consequently be obnoxious to the like"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7534,"injuries from others; and to avoyd this, breaks the Law, and protects"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7535,"himselfe for the future, by the terrour of his private revenge. This is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7536,"a Crime; For the hurt is not Corporeall, but Phantasticall, and (though"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7537,"in this corner of the world, made sensible by a custome not many years"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7538,"since begun, amongst young and vain men,) so light, as a gallant man,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7539,"and one that is assured of his own courage, cannot take notice of. Also"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7540,"a man may stand in fear of Spirits, either through his own superstition,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7541,"or through too much credit given to other men, that tell him of strange"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7542,"Dreams and visions; and thereby be made believe they will hurt him, for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7543,"doing, or omitting divers things, which neverthelesse, to do, or omit,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7544,"is contrary to the Lawes; And that which is so done, or omitted, is not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7545,to be Excused by this fear; but is a Crime. For (as I have shewn before
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7546,in the second Chapter) Dreams be naturally but the fancies remaining in
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7547,"sleep, after the impressions our Senses had formerly received waking;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7548,"and when men are by any accident unassured they have slept, seem to be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7549,reall Visions; and therefore he that presumes to break the Law upon his
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7550,"own, or anothers Dream, or pretended Vision, or upon other Fancy of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7551,"the power of Invisible Spirits, than is permitted by the Common-wealth,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7552,"leaveth the Law of Nature, which is a certain offence, and followeth the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7553,"imagery of his own, or another private mans brain, which he can never"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7554,"know whether it signifieth any thing, or nothing, nor whether he that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7555,"tells his Dream, say true, or lye; which if every private man should"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7556,"have leave to do, (as they must by the Law of Nature, if any one have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7557,"it) there could no Law be made to hold, and so all Common-wealth would"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7558,be dissolved.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7559,Crimes Not Equall
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7560,"From these different sources of Crimes, it appeares already, that all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7561,Crimes are not (as the Stoicks of old time maintained) of the same
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7562,"allay. There is place, not only for EXCUSE, by which that which seemed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7563,"a Crime, is proved to be none at all; but also for EXTENUATION, by which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7564,"the Crime, that seemed great, is made lesse. For though all Crimes doe"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7565,"equally deserve the name of Injustice, as all deviation from a strait"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7566,"line is equally crookednesse, which the Stoicks rightly observed; yet"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7567,"it does not follow that all Crimes are equally unjust, no more than that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7568,"all crooked lines are equally crooked; which the Stoicks not observing,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7569,"held it as great a Crime, to kill a Hen, against the Law, as to kill"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7570,ones Father.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7571,Totall Excuses
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7572,"That which totally Excuseth a Fact, and takes away from it the nature of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7573,"a Crime, can be none but that, which at the same time, taketh away the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7574,"obligation of the Law. For the fact committed once against the Law,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7575,"if he that committed it be obliged to the Law, can be no other than a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7576,Crime.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7577,"The want of means to know the Law, totally Excuseth: For the Law whereof"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7578,"a man has no means to enforme himself, is not obligatory. But the want"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7579,"of diligence to enquire, shall not be considered as a want of means; Nor"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7580,"shall any man, that pretendeth to reason enough for the Government of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7581,"his own affairs, be supposed to want means to know the Lawes of Nature;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7582,"because they are known by the reason he pretends to: only Children, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7583,Madmen are Excused from offences against the Law Naturall.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7584,"Where a man is captive, or in the power of the enemy, (and he is then in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7585,"the power of the enemy, when his person, or his means of living, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7586,"so,) if it be without his own fault, the Obligation of the Law ceaseth;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7587,"because he must obey the enemy, or dye; and consequently such obedience"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7588,is no Crime: for no man is obliged (when the protection of the Law
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7589,"faileth,) not to protect himself, by the best means he can."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7590,"If a man by the terrour of present death, be compelled to doe a fact"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7591,"against the Law, he is totally Excused; because no Law can oblige a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7592,man to abandon his own preservation. And supposing such a Law were
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7593,"obligatory; yet a man would reason thus, ""If I doe it not, I die"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7594,"presently; if I doe it, I die afterwards; therefore by doing it, there"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7595,"is time of life gained;"" Nature therefore compells him to the fact."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7596,"When a man is destitute of food, or other thing necessary for his life,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7597,"and cannot preserve himselfe any other way, but by some fact against"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7598,"the Law; as if in a great famine he take the food by force, or stealth,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7599,"which he cannot obtaine for mony nor charity; or in defence of his life,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7600,"snatch away another mans Sword, he is totally Excused, for the reason"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7601,next before alledged.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7602,Excuses Against The Author
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7603,"Again, Facts done against the Law, by the authority of another, are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7604,by that authority Excused against the Author; because no man ought to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7605,"accuse his own fact in another, that is but his instrument: but it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7606,is not Excused against a third person thereby injured; because in the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7607,"violation of the law, bothe the Author, and Actor are Criminalls."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7608,"From hence it followeth that when that Man, or Assembly, that hath the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7609,"Soveraign Power, commandeth a man to do that which is contrary to a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7610,"former Law, the doing of it is totally Excused: For he ought not to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7611,"condemn it himselfe, because he is the Author; and what cannot justly"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7612,"be condemned by the Soveraign, cannot justly be punished by any other."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7613,"Besides, when the Soveraign commandeth any thing to be done against"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7614,"his own former Law, the Command, as to that particular fact, is an"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7615,abrogation of the Law.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7616,"If that Man, or Assembly, that hath the Soveraign Power, disclaime"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7617,"any Right essentiall to the Soveraignty, whereby there accrueth to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7618,"Subject, any liberty inconsistent with the Soveraign Power, that is to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7619,"say, with the very being of a Common-wealth, if the Subject shall refuse"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7620,"to obey the Command in any thing, contrary to the liberty granted, this"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7621,"is neverthelesse a Sinne, and contrary to the duty of the Subject: for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7622,"he ought to take notice of what is inconsistent with the Soveraignty,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7623,"because it was erected by his own consent, and for his own defence;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7624,"and that such liberty as is inconsistent with it, was granted through"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7625,"ignorance of the evill consequence thereof. But if he not onely disobey,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7626,"but also resist a publique Minister in the execution of it, then it is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7627,"a Crime; because he might have been righted, (without any breach of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7628,"Peace,) upon complaint."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7629,"The Degrees of Crime are taken on divers Scales, and measured, First, by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7630,"the malignity of the Source, or Cause: Secondly, by the contagion of the"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7649,"Interpreter of the Law publiquely authorised, is not so faulty, as he"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7662,the Soveraign himselfe: And because he which furnishes a man with such
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7663,"a hope, and presumption of mercy, as encourageth him to offend, hath his"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7667,"A Crime arising from a sudden Passion, is not so great, as when the same"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7668,ariseth from long meditation: For in the former case there is a place
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7669,"for Extenuation, in the common infirmity of humane nature: but he that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7670,"doth it with praemeditation, has used circumspection, and cast his eye,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7671,"on the Law, on the punishment, and on the consequence thereof to humane"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7672,"society; all which in committing the Crime, hee hath contemned, and"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7681,"difficulty, uncertainty, and interruption of their Callings, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7682,"be informed by private men: for in this case, part of the fault is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7683,discharged upon common infirmity; but in the former there is apparent
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7684,"negligence, which is not without some contempt of the Soveraign Power."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7685,"Tacite Approbation Of The Soveraign, Extenuates"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7686,"Those facts which the Law expresly condemneth, but the Law-maker by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7687,"other manifest signes of his will tacitly approveth, are lesse Crimes,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7688,"than the same facts, condemned both by the Law, and Lawmaker. For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7689,"seeing the will of the Law-maker is a Law, there appear in this case two"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7690,"contradictory Lawes; which would totally Excuse, if men were bound to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7691,"take notice of the Soveraigns approbation, by other arguments, than are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7692,"expressed by his command. But because there are punishments consequent,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7693,"not onely to the transgression of his Law, but also to the observing"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7694,"of it, he is in part a cause of the transgression, and therefore cannot"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7695,"reasonably impute the whole Crime to the Delinquent. For example, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7696,Law condemneth Duells; the punishment is made capitall: On the contrary
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7697,"part, he that refuseth Duell, is subject to contempt and scorne, without"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7698,remedy; and sometimes by the Soveraign himselfe thought unworthy to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7699,"have any charge, or preferment in Warre: If thereupon he accept Duell,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7700,considering all men lawfully endeavour to obtain the good opinion
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7701,"of them that have the Soveraign Power, he ought not in reason to be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7702,rigorously punished; seeing part of the fault may be discharged on the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7703,"punisher; which I say, not as wishing liberty of private revenges,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7704,"or any other kind of disobedience; but a care in Governours, not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7705,"to countenance any thing obliquely, which directly they forbid. The"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7706,"examples of Princes, to those that see them, are, and ever have been,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7707,"more potent to govern their actions, than the Lawes themselves. And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7708,"though it be our duty to do, not what they do, but what they say; yet"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7709,"will that duty never be performed, till it please God to give men an"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7710,"extraordinary, and supernaturall grace to follow that Precept."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7711,Comparison Of Crimes From Their Effects
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7712,"Again, if we compare Crimes by the mischiefe of their Effects, First,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7713,"the same fact, when it redounds to the dammage of many, is greater, than"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7714,"when it redounds to the hurt of few. And therefore, when a fact hurteth,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7715,"not onely in the present, but also, (by example) in the future, it is a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7716,"greater Crime, than if it hurt onely in the present: for the former,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7717,"is a fertile Crime, and multiplyes to the hurt of many; the later is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7718,barren. To maintain doctrines contrary to the Religion established in
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7719,"the Common-wealth, is a greater fault, in an authorised Preacher, than"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7720,"in a private person: So also is it, to live prophanely, incontinently,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7721,or do any irreligious act whatsoever. Likewise in a Professor of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7722,"Law, to maintain any point, on do any act, that tendeth to the weakning"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7723,"of the Soveraign Power, as a greater Crime, than in another man: Also in"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7725,"followed, or his actions imitated by many, his fact against the Law, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7726,"a greater Crime, than the same fact in another: For such men not onely"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7727,"commit Crime, but teach it for Law to all other men. And generally all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7728,"Crimes are the greater, by the scandall they give; that is to say, by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7729,"becoming stumbling-blocks to the weak, that look not so much upon the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7730,"way they go in, as upon the light that other men carry before them."

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7732,"Also Facts of Hostility against the present state of the Common-wealth,"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7734,the dammage extends it selfe to all: Such are the betraying of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7735,"strengths, or revealing of the secrets of the Common-wealth to an Enemy;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7736,"also all attempts upon the Representative of the Common-wealth, be it a"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7744,"mony to give False judgement, or testimony, is a greater Crime, than"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7745,"otherwise to deceive a man of the like, or a greater summe; because not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7746,"onely he has wrong, that falls by such judgements; but all Judgements"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7747,"are rendered uselesse, and occasion ministred to force, and private"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7750,"Also Robbery, and Depeculation of the Publique treasure, or Revenues,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7751,"is a greater Crime, than the robbing, or defrauding of a Private man;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7752,"because to robbe the publique, is to robbe many at once."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7753,Counterfeiting Authority

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7756,"counterfeiting of a private mans person, or his seale; because the fraud"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7758,Crimes Against Private Men Compared
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7759,"Of facts against the Law, done to private men, the greater Crime, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7760,"that, where the dammage in the common opinion of men, is most sensible."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7761,And therefore
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7762,"To kill against the Law, is a greater Crime, that any other injury, life"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7763,preserved.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7764,"And to kill with Torment, greater, than simply to kill."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7765,"And Mutilation of a limbe, greater, than the spoyling a man of his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7766,goods.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7767,"And the spoyling a man of his goods, by Terrour of death, or wounds,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7768,than by clandestine surreption.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7769,"And by clandestine Surreption, than by consent fraudulently obtained."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7770,"And the violation of chastity by Force, greater, than by flattery."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7771,"And of a woman Married, than of a woman not married."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7772,"For all these things are commonly so valued; though some men are more,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7773,and some lesse sensible of the same offence. But the Law regardeth not
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7774,"the particular, but the generall inclination of mankind."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7775,"And therefore the offence men take, from contumely, in words, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7776,"gesture, when they produce no other harme, than the present griefe of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7777,"him that is reproached, hath been neglected in the Lawes of the Greeks,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7778,"Romans, and other both antient, and moderne Common-wealths; supposing"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7779,"the true cause of such griefe to consist, not in the contumely, (which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7780,"takes no hold upon men conscious of their own Vertue,) but in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7781,Pusillanimity of him that is offended by it.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7782,"Also a Crime against a private man, is much aggravated by the person,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7783,"time, and place. For to kill ones Parent, is a greater Crime, than to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7784,"kill another: for the Parent ought to have the honour of a Soveraign,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7785,"(though he have surrendred his Power to the Civill Law,) because he had"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7786,"it originally by Nature. And to Robbe a poore man, is a greater Crime,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7787,than to robbe a rich man; because 'tis to the poore a more sensible
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7788,dammage.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7789,"And a Crime committed in the Time, or Place appointed for Devotion, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7790,"greater, than if committed at another time or place: for it proceeds"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7791,from a greater contempt of the Law.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7792,"Many other cases of Aggravation, and Extenuation might be added: but by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7793,"these I have set down, it is obvious to every man, to take the altitude"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7794,of any other Crime proposed.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7795,Publique Crimes What
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,27,7796,"Lastly, because in almost all Crimes there is an Injury done, not onely"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7804,"CHAPTER XXVIII. OF PUNISHMENTS, AND REWARDS"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7805,The Definition Of Punishment
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7806,"""A PUNISHMENT, is an Evill inflicted by publique Authority, on him that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7807,"hath done, or omitted that which is Judged by the same Authority to be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7808,a Transgression of the Law; to the end that the will of men may thereby
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7809,"the better be disposed to obedience."""
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7810,Right To Punish Whence Derived
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7811,"Before I inferre any thing from this definition, there is a question to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7812,"be answered, of much importance; which is, by what door the Right, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7813,"Authority of Punishing in any case, came in. For by that which has"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7814,"been said before, no man is supposed bound by Covenant, not to resist"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7815,"violence; and consequently it cannot be intended, that he gave any right"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7816,to another to lay violent hands upon his person. In the making of a
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7817,"Common-wealth, every man giveth away the right of defending another; but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7818,"not of defending himselfe. Also he obligeth himselfe, to assist him that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7819,"hath the Soveraignty, in the Punishing of another; but of himselfe"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7820,"not. But to covenant to assist the Soveraign, in doing hurt to another,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7821,"unlesse he that so covenanteth have a right to doe it himselfe, is not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7822,to give him a Right to Punish. It is manifest therefore that the Right
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7823,"which the Common-wealth (that is, he, or they that represent it) hath to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7824,"Punish, is not grounded on any concession, or gift of the Subjects."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7825,"But I have also shewed formerly, that before the Institution of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7826,"Common-wealth, every man had a right to every thing, and to do"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7827,"whatsoever he thought necessary to his own preservation; subduing,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7828,"hurting, or killing any man in order thereunto. And this is the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7829,"foundation of that right of Punishing, which is exercised in every"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7830,Common-wealth. For the Subjects did not give the Soveraign that right;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7831,"but onely in laying down theirs, strengthned him to use his own, as he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7832,"should think fit, for the preservation of them all: so that it was not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7833,"given, but left to him, and to him onely; and (excepting the limits set"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7834,"him by naturall Law) as entire, as in the condition of meer Nature, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7835,of warre of every one against his neighbour.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7836,"Private Injuries, And Revenges No Punishments"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7837,"From the definition of Punishment, I inferre, First, that neither"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7838,"private revenges, nor injuries of private men, can properly be stiled"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7839,Punishment; because they proceed not from publique Authority.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7840,Nor Denyall Of Preferment
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7841,"Secondly, that to be neglected, and unpreferred by the publique"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7842,"favour, is not a Punishment; because no new evill is thereby on any man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7843,Inflicted; he is onely left in the estate he was in before.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7844,Nor Pain Inflicted Without Publique Hearing
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7845,"Thirdly, that the evill inflicted by publique Authority, without"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7846,"precedent publique condemnation, is not to be stiled by the name of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7847,Punishment; but of an hostile act; because the fact for which a man
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7848,"is Punished, ought first to be Judged by publique Authority, to be a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7849,transgression of the Law.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7850,Nor Pain Inflicted By Usurped Power
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7851,"Fourthly, that the evill inflicted by usurped power, and Judges"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7852,"without Authority from the Soveraign, is not Punishment; but an act of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7853,"hostility; because the acts of power usurped, have not for Author, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7854,person condemned; and therefore are not acts of publique Authority.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7855,Nor Pain Inflicted Without Respect To The Future Good
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7856,"Fifthly, that all evill which is inflicted without intention, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7857,"possibility of disposing the Delinquent, or (by his example) other men,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7858,"to obey the Lawes, is not Punishment; but an act of hostility; because"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7859,"without such an end, no hurt done is contained under that name."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7860,"Naturall Evill Consequences, No Punishments"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7861,"Sixthly, whereas to certain actions, there be annexed by Nature, divers"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7862,"hurtfull consequences; as when a man in assaulting another, is himselfe"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7863,"slain, or wounded; or when he falleth into sicknesse by the doing of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7864,"some unlawfull act; such hurt, though in respect of God, who is the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7865,"author of Nature, it may be said to be inflicted, and therefore a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7866,Punishment divine; yet it is not contaned in the name of Punishment in
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7867,"respect of men, because it is not inflicted by the Authority of man."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7868,"Hurt Inflicted, If Lesse Than The Benefit Of Transgressing,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7869,Is Not Punishment
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7870,"Seventhly, If the harm inflicted be lesse than the benefit, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7871,"contentment that naturally followeth the crime committed, that harm is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7872,"not within the definition; and is rather the Price, or Redemption, than"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7873,"the Punishment of a Crime: Because it is of the nature of Punishment, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7874,"have for end, the disposing of men to obey the Law; which end (if it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7875,"be lesse that the benefit of the transgression) it attaineth not, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7876,worketh a contrary effect.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7877,"Where The Punishment Is Annexed To The Law, A Greater Hurt Is Not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7878,"Punishment, But Hostility"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7879,"Eighthly, If a Punishment be determined and prescribed in the Law it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7880,"selfe, and after the crime committed, there be a greater Punishment"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7881,"inflicted, the excesse is not Punishment, but an act of hostility. For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7882,"seeing the aym of Punishment is not a revenge, but terrour; and the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7883,"terrour of a great Punishment unknown, is taken away by the declaration"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7884,"of a lesse, the unexpected addition is no part of the Punishment."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7885,"But where there is no Punishment at all determined by the Law, there"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7886,"whatsoever is inflicted, hath the nature of Punishment. For he that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7887,"goes about the violation of a Law, wherein no penalty is determined,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7888,"expecteth an indeterminate, that is to say, an arbitrary Punishment."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7889,"Hurt Inflicted For A Fact Done Before The Law, No Punishment"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7890,"Ninthly, Harme inflicted for a Fact done before there was a Law that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7891,"forbad it, is not Punishment, but an act of Hostility: For before the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7892,"Law, there is no transgression of the Law: But Punishment supposeth a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7893,"fact judged, to have been a transgression of the Law; Therefore"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7894,"Harme inflicted before the Law made, is not Punishment, but an act of"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7896,The Representative Of The Common-wealth Unpunishable
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7897,"Tenthly, Hurt inflicted on the Representative of the Common-wealth, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7898,"not Punishment, but an act of Hostility: Because it is of the nature"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7899,"of Punishment, to be inflicted by publique Authority, which is the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7900,Authority only of the Representative it self.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7901,"Hurt To Revolted Subjects Is Done By Right Of War, Not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7902,By Way Of Punishment
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7903,"Lastly, Harme inflicted upon one that is a declared enemy, fals not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7904,under the name of Punishment: Because seeing they were either never
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7905,"subject to the Law, and therefore cannot transgresse it; or having been"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7906,"subject to it, and professing to be no longer so, by consequence deny"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7907,"they can transgresse it, all the Harmes that can be done them, must be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7908,"taken as acts of Hostility. But in declared Hostility, all infliction of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7909,"evill is lawfull. From whence it followeth, that if a subject shall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7910,"by fact, or word, wittingly, and deliberatly deny the authority of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7911,"the Representative of the Common-wealth, (whatsoever penalty hath"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7912,"been formerly ordained for Treason,) he may lawfully be made to suffer"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7913,"whatsoever the Representative will: For in denying subjection, he denyes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7914,such Punishment as by the Law hath been ordained; and therefore suffers
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7915,"as an enemy of the Common-wealth; that is, according to the will of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7916,"the Representative. For the Punishments set down in the Law, are to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7917,"Subjects, not to Enemies; such as are they, that having been by their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7918,"own act Subjects, deliberately revolting, deny the Soveraign Power."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7919,"The first, and most generall distribution of Punishments, is into"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7920,"Divine, and Humane. Of the former I shall have occasion, to speak, in a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7921,more convenient place hereafter.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7922,"Humane, are those Punishments that be inflicted by the Commandement"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7923,"of Man; and are either Corporall, or Pecuniary, or Ignominy, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7924,"Imprisonment, or Exile, or mixt of these."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7925,Punishments Corporall
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7926,"Corporall Punishment is that, which is inflicted on the body directly,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7927,and according to the intention of him that inflicteth it: such as are
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7928,"stripes, or wounds, or deprivation of such pleasures of the body, as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7929,were before lawfully enjoyed.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7930,Capitall
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7931,"And of these, some be Capitall, some Lesse than Capitall. Capitall, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7932,"the Infliction of Death; and that either simply, or with torment. Lesse"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7933,"than Capitall, are Stripes, Wounds, Chains, and any other corporall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7934,"Paine, not in its own nature mortall. For if upon the Infliction of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7935,"a Punishment death follow not in the Intention of the Inflicter, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7936,"Punishment is not be bee esteemed Capitall, though the harme prove"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7937,mortall by an accident not to be foreseen; in which case death is not
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7938,"inflicted, but hastened."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7939,"Pecuniary Punishment, is that which consisteth not only in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7940,"deprivation of a Summe of Mony, but also of Lands, or any other goods"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7941,"which are usually bought and sold for mony. And in case the Law, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7942,"ordaineth such a punishment, be made with design to gather mony, from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7943,"such as shall transgresse the same, it is not properly a Punishment,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7944,"but the Price of priviledge, and exemption from the Law, which doth not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7945,"absolutely forbid the fact, but only to those that are not able to pay"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7946,"the mony: except where the Law is Naturall, or part of Religion; for in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7947,"that case it is not an exemption from the Law, but a transgression of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7948,"it. As where a Law exacteth a Pecuniary mulct, of them that take the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7949,"name of God in vaine, the payment of the mulct, is not the price of a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7950,"dispensation to sweare, but the Punishment of the transgression of a Law"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7951,undispensable. In like manner if the Law impose a Summe of Mony to be
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7952,"payd, to him that has been Injured; this is but a satisfaction for the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7953,"hurt done him; and extinguisheth the accusation of the party injured,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7954,not the crime of the offender.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7955,Ignominy
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7956,"Ignominy, is the infliction of such Evill, as is made Dishonorable;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7957,"or the deprivation of such Good, as is made Honourable by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7958,Common-wealth. For there be some things Honorable by Nature; as the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7959,"effects of Courage, Magnanimity, Strength, Wisdome, and other abilities"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7960,"of body and mind: Others made Honorable by the Common-wealth; as Badges,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7961,"Titles, Offices, or any other singular marke of the Soveraigns favour."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7962,"The former, (though they may faile by nature, or accident,) cannot be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7963,taken away by a Law; and therefore the losse of them is not Punishment.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7964,"But the later, may be taken away by the publique authority that made"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7965,"them Honorable, and are properly Punishments: Such are degrading men"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7966,"condemned, of their Badges, Titles, and Offices; or declaring them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7967,uncapable of the like in time to come.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7968,Imprisonment
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7969,"Imprisonment, is when a man is by publique Authority deprived of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7970,liberty; and may happen from two divers ends; whereof one is the safe
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7971,custody of a man accused; the other is the inflicting of paine on a man
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7972,condemned. The former is not Punishment; because no man is supposed
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7973,"to be Punisht, before he be Judicially heard, and declared guilty."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7974,"And therefore whatsoever hurt a man is made to suffer by bonds, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7975,"restraint, before his cause be heard, over and above that which is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7976,"necessary to assure his custody, is against the Law of Nature. But the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7977,"Later is Punishment, because Evill, and inflicted by publique Authority,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7978,for somewhat that has by the same Authority been Judged a Transgression
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7979,"of the Law. Under this word Imprisonment, I comprehend all restraint of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7980,"motion, caused by an externall obstacle, be it a House, which is called"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7981,"by the generall name of a Prison; or an Iland, as when men are said to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7982,"be confined to it; or a place where men are set to worke, as in old time"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7983,"men have been condemned to Quarries, and in these times to Gallies; or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7984,"be it a Chaine, or any other such impediment."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7985,Exile
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7986,"Exile, (Banishment) is when a man is for a crime, condemned to depart"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7987,"out of the dominion of the Common-wealth, or out of a certaine part"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7988,"thereof; and during a prefixed time, or for ever, not to return into it:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7989,"and seemeth not in its own nature, without other circumstances, to be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7990,"a Punishment; but rather an escape, or a publique commandement to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7991,"avoid Punishment by flight. And Cicero sayes, there was never any such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7992,Punishment ordained in the City of Rome; but cals it a refuge of men in
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7993,"danger. For if a man banished, be neverthelesse permitted to enjoy"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7994,"his Goods, and the Revenue of his Lands, the meer change of ayr is no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7995,"punishment; nor does it tend to that benefit of the Common-wealth, for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7996,"which all Punishments are ordained, (that is to say, to the forming of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7997,mens wils to the observation of the Law;) but many times to the dammage
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7998,"of the Common-wealth. For a Banished man, is a lawfull enemy of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,7999,Common-wealth that banished him; as being no more a Member of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8000,"same. But if he be withall deprived of his Lands, or Goods, then"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8001,"the Punishment lyeth not in the Exile, but is to be reckoned amongst"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8002,Punishments Pecuniary.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8003,The Punishment Of Innocent Subjects Is Contrary To The Law Of Nature
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8004,"All Punishments of Innocent subjects, be they great or little, are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8005,against the Law of Nature; For Punishment is only of Transgression of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8006,"the Law, and therefore there can be no Punishment of the Innocent. It"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8007,"is therefore a violation, First, of that Law of Nature, which forbiddeth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8008,"all men, in their Revenges, to look at any thing but some future good:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8009,"For there can arrive no good to the Common-wealth, by Punishing the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8010,"Innocent. Secondly, of that, which forbiddeth Ingratitude: For seeing"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8011,"all Soveraign Power, is originally given by the consent of every one of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8012,"the Subjects, to the end they should as long as they are obedient, be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8013,"protected thereby; the Punishment of the Innocent, is a rendring of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8014,"Evill for Good. And thirdly, of the Law that commandeth Equity; that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8015,"is to say, an equall distribution of Justice; which in Punishing the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8016,Innocent is not observed.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8017,"But The Harme Done To Innocents In War, Not So"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8018,"But the Infliction of what evill soever, on an Innocent man, that is not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8019,"a Subject, if it be for the benefit of the Common-wealth, and without"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8020,"violation of any former Covenant, is no breach of the Law of Nature."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8021,"For all men that are not Subjects, are either Enemies, or else they have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8022,"ceased from being so, by some precedent covenants. But against Enemies,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8023,"whom the Common-wealth judgeth capable to do them hurt, it is lawfull by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8024,the originall Right of Nature to make warre; wherein the Sword Judgeth
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8025,"not, nor doth the Victor make distinction of Nocent and Innocent, as to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8026,"the time past; nor has other respect of mercy, than as it conduceth to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8027,"the good of his own People. And upon this ground it is, that also"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8028,"in Subjects, who deliberatly deny the Authority of the Common-wealth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8029,"established, the vengeance is lawfully extended, not onely to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8030,"Fathers, but also to the third and fourth generation not yet in being,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8031,"and consequently innocent of the fact, for which they are afflicted:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8032,"because the nature of this offence, consisteth in the renouncing of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8033,"subjection; which is a relapse into the condition of warre, commonly"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8034,"called Rebellion; and they that so offend, suffer not as Subjects, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8035,"as Enemies. For Rebellion, is but warre renewed."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8036,"Reward, Is Either Salary, Or Grace"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8037,"REWARD, is either of Gift, or by Contract. When by Contract, it is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8038,"called Salary, and Wages; which is benefit due for service performed, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8039,"promised. When of Gift, it is benefit proceeding from the Grace of them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8040,"that bestow it, to encourage, or enable men to do them service. And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8041,therefore when the Soveraign of a Common-wealth appointeth a Salary
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8042,"to any publique Office, he that receiveth it, is bound in Justice"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8043,"to performe his office; otherwise, he is bound onely in honour, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8044,"acknowledgement, and an endeavour of requitall. For though men have no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8045,"lawfull remedy, when they be commanded to quit their private businesse,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8046,"to serve the publique, without Reward, or Salary; yet they are not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8047,"bound thereto, by the Law of Nature, nor by the institution of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8048,"Common-wealth, unlesse the service cannot otherwise be done; because it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8049,"is supposed the Soveraign may make use of all their means, insomuch as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8050,"the most common Souldier, may demand the wages of his warrefare, as a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8051,debt.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8052,"Benefits Bestowed For Fear, Are Not Rewards"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8053,"The benefits which a Soveraign bestoweth on a Subject, for fear of some"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8054,"power, and ability he hath to do hurt to the Common-wealth, are not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8055,properly Rewards; for they are not Salaryes; because there is in this
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8056,"case no contract supposed, every man being obliged already not to do the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8057,Common-wealth disservice: nor are they Graces; because they be extorted
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8058,"by feare, which ought not to be incident to the Soveraign Power: but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8059,"are rather Sacrifices, which the Soveraign (considered in his naturall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8060,"person, and not in the person of the Common-wealth) makes, for the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8061,appeasing the discontent of him he thinks more potent than himselfe; and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8062,"encourage not to obedience, but on the contrary, to the continuance, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8063,increasing of further extortion.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8064,Salaries Certain And Casuall
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8065,"And whereas some Salaries are certain, and proceed from the publique"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8066,"Treasure; and others uncertain, and casuall, proceeding from the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8067,execution of the Office for which the Salary is ordained; the later
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8068,is in some cases hurtfull to the Common-wealth; as in the case of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8069,"Judicature. For where the benefit of the Judges, and Ministers of a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8070,"Court of Justice, ariseth for the multitude of Causes that are brought"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8071,"to their cognisance, there must needs follow two Inconveniences: One,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8072,"is the nourishing of sutes; for the more sutes, the greater benefit: and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8073,"another that depends on that, which is contention about Jurisdiction;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8074,"each Court drawing to it selfe, as many Causes as it can. But in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8075,offices of Execution there are not those Inconveniences; because their
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8076,employment cannot be encreased by any endeavour of their own. And thus
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8077,"much shall suffice for the nature of Punishment, and Reward; which are,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8078,"as it were, the Nerves and Tendons, that move the limbes and joynts of a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8079,Common-wealth.

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8081,Passions have compelled him to submit himselfe to Government;) together
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8082,"with the great power of his Governour, whom I compared to Leviathan,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8083,taking that comparison out of the two last verses of the one and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8084,fortieth of Job; where God having set forth the great power of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8085,"Leviathan, called him King of the Proud. ""There is nothing,"" saith he,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8086,"""on earth, to be compared with him. He is made so as not be afraid. Hee"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8087,seeth every high thing below him; and is King of all the children of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8088,"pride."" But because he is mortall, and subject to decay, as all other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8089,"Earthly creatures are; and because there is that in heaven, (though not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8090,"on earth) that he should stand in fear of, and whose Lawes he ought to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8091,"obey; I shall in the next following Chapters speak of his Diseases, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,28,8092,the causes of his Mortality; and of what Lawes of Nature he is bound to

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8094,"CHAPTER XXIX. OF THOSE THINGS THAT WEAKEN, OR TEND TO THE DISSOLUTION OF"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8095,A COMMON-WEALTH
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8096,Dissolution Of Common-wealths Proceedeth From Imperfect Institution
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8097,"Though nothing can be immortall, which mortals make; yet, if men had the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8098,"use of reason they pretend to, their Common-wealths might be secured, at"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8099,"least, from perishing by internall diseases. For by the nature of their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8100,"Institution, they are designed to live, as long as Man-kind, or as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8101,"the Lawes of Nature, or as Justice it selfe, which gives them life."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8102,"Therefore when they come to be dissolved, not by externall violence, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8103,"intestine disorder, the fault is not in men, as they are the Matter; but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8104,"as they are the Makers, and orderers of them. For men, as they become"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8105,"at last weary of irregular justling, and hewing one another, and desire"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8106,"with all their hearts, to conforme themselves into one firme and lasting"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8107,"edifice; so for want, both of the art of making fit Laws, to square"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8108,"their actions by, and also of humility, and patience, to suffer the rude"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8109,"and combersome points of their present greatnesse to be taken off, they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8110,"cannot without the help of a very able Architect, be compiled, into any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8111,"other than a crasie building, such as hardly lasting out their own time,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8112,must assuredly fall upon the heads of their posterity.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8113,"Amongst the Infirmities therefore of a Common-wealth, I will reckon in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8114,"the first place, those that arise from an Imperfect Institution,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8115,"and resemble the diseases of a naturall body, which proceed from a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8116,Defectuous Procreation.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8117,Want Of Absolute Power
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8118,"Of which, this is one, ""That a man to obtain a Kingdome, is sometimes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8119,"content with lesse Power, than to the Peace, and defence of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8120,"Common-wealth is necessarily required."" From whence it commeth to passe,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8121,"that when the exercise of the Power layd by, is for the publique safety"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8122,"to be resumed, it hath the resemblance of as unjust act; which disposeth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8123,great numbers of men (when occasion is presented) to rebell; In the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8124,"same manner as the bodies of children, gotten by diseased parents, are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8125,"subject either to untimely death, or to purge the ill quality, derived"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8126,"from their vicious conception, by breaking out into biles and scabbs."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8127,"And when Kings deny themselves some such necessary Power, it is not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8128,alwayes (though sometimes) out of ignorance of what is necessary to the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8129,office they undertake; but many times out of a hope to recover the same
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8130,again at their pleasure: Wherein they reason not well; because such as
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8131,"will hold them to their promises, shall be maintained against them by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8132,forraign Common-wealths; who in order to the good of their own Subjects
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8133,let slip few occasions to Weaken the estate of their Neighbours. So was
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8134,"Thomas Beckett Archbishop of Canterbury, supported against Henry"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8135,"the Second, by the Pope; the subjection of Ecclesiastiques to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8136,"Common-wealth, having been dispensed with by William the Conqueror at"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8137,"his reception, when he took an Oath, not to infringe the liberty of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8138,"Church. And so were the Barons, whose power was by William Rufus (to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8139,"have their help in transferring the Succession from his Elder brother,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8140,"to himselfe,) encreased to a degree, inconsistent with the Soveraign"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8141,"Power, maintained in their Rebellion against King John, by the French."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8142,Nor does this happen in Monarchy onely. For whereas the stile of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8143,"antient Roman Common-wealth, was, The Senate, and People of Rome;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8144,"neither Senate, nor People pretended to the whole Power; which first"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8145,"caused the seditions, of Tiberius Gracchus, Caius Gracchus, Lucius"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8146,"Saturnius, and others; and afterwards the warres between the Senate and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8147,"the People, under Marius and Sylla; and again under Pompey and Caesar,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8148,"to the Extinction of their Democraty, and the setting up of Monarchy."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8149,The people of Athens bound themselves but from one onely Action; which
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8150,"was, that no man on pain of death should propound the renewing of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8151,"warre for the Island of Salamis; And yet thereby, if Solon had not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8152,"caused to be given out he was mad, and afterwards in gesture and habit"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8153,"of a mad-man, and in verse, propounded it to the People that flocked"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8154,"about him, they had had an enemy perpetually in readinesse, even at the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8155,"gates of their Citie; such dammage, or shifts, are all Common-wealths"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8156,"forced to, that have their Power never so little limited."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8157,Private Judgement Of Good and Evill
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8158,"In the second place, I observe the Diseases of a Common-wealth, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8159,"proceed from the poyson of seditious doctrines; whereof one is, ""That"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8160,"every private man is Judge of Good and Evill actions."" This is true in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8161,"the condition of meer Nature, where there are no Civill Lawes; and also"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8162,"under Civill Government, in such cases as are not determined by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8163,"Law. But otherwise, it is manifest, that the measure of Good and Evill"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8164,"actions, is the Civill Law; and the Judge the Legislator, who is alwayes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8165,"Representative of the Common-wealth. From this false doctrine, men are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8166,"disposed to debate with themselves, and dispute the commands of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8167,"Common-wealth; and afterwards to obey, or disobey them, as in their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8168,private judgements they shall think fit. Whereby the Common-wealth is
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8169,distracted and Weakened.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8170,Erroneous Conscience
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8171,"Another doctrine repugnant to Civill Society, is, that ""Whatsoever a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8172,"man does against his Conscience, is Sinne;"" and it dependeth on the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8173,presumption of making himself judge of Good and Evill. For a mans
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8174,"Conscience, and his Judgement is the same thing; and as the Judgement,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8175,"so also the Conscience may be erroneous. Therefore, though he that is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8176,"subject to no Civill Law, sinneth in all he does against his Conscience,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8177,because he has no other rule to follow but his own reason; yet it is
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8178,not so with him that lives in a Common-wealth; because the Law is the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8179,"publique Conscience, by which he hath already undertaken to be guided."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8180,"Otherwise in such diversity, as there is of private Consciences, which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8181,"are but private opinions, the Common-wealth must needs be distracted,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8182,"and no man dare to obey the Soveraign Power, farther than it shall seem"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8183,good in his own eyes.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8184,Pretence Of Inspiration
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8185,"It hath been also commonly taught, ""That Faith and Sanctity, are not to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8186,"be attained by Study and Reason, but by supernaturall Inspiration, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8187,"Infusion,"" which granted, I see not why any man should render a reason"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8188,of his Faith; or why every Christian should not be also a Prophet; or
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8189,"why any man should take the Law of his Country, rather than his own"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8190,"Inspiration, for the rule of his action. And thus wee fall again into"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8191,the fault of taking upon us to Judge of Good and Evill; or to make
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8192,"Judges of it, such private men as pretend to be supernaturally Inspired,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8193,"to the Dissolution of all Civill Government. Faith comes by hearing,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8194,"and hearing by those accidents, which guide us into the presence of them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8195,that speak to us; which accidents are all contrived by God Almighty; and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8196,"yet are not supernaturall, but onely, for the great number of them that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8197,"concurre to every effect, unobservable. Faith, and Sanctity, are indeed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8198,"not very frequent; but yet they are not Miracles, but brought to passe"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8199,"by education, discipline, correction, and other naturall wayes, by which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8200,"God worketh them in his elect, as such time as he thinketh fit. And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8201,"these three opinions, pernicious to Peace and Government, have in this"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8202,"part of the world, proceeded chiefly from the tongues, and pens of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8203,"unlearned Divines; who joyning the words of Holy Scripture together,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8204,"otherwise than is agreeable to reason, do what they can, to make men"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8205,"think, that Sanctity and Naturall Reason, cannot stand together."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8206,Subjecting The Soveraign Power To Civill Lawes
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8207,"A fourth opinion, repugnant to the nature of a Common-wealth, is this,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8208,"""That he that hath the Soveraign Power, is subject to the Civill Lawes."""
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8209,"It is true, that Soveraigns are all subjects to the Lawes of Nature;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8210,"because such lawes be Divine, and cannot by any man, or Common-wealth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8211,"be abrogated. But to those Lawes which the Soveraign himselfe, that is,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8212,"which the Common-wealth maketh, he is not subject. For to be subject to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8213,"Lawes, is to be subject to the Common-wealth, that is to the Soveraign"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8214,"Representative, that is to himselfe; which is not subjection, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8215,"freedome from the Lawes. Which errour, because it setteth the Lawes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8216,"above the Soveraign, setteth also a Judge above him, and a Power to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8217,punish him; which is to make a new Soveraign; and again for the same
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8218,"reason a third, to punish the second; and so continually without end, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8219,"the Confusion, and Dissolution of the Common-wealth."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8220,Attributing Of Absolute Propriety To The Subjects
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8221,"A Fifth doctrine, that tendeth to the Dissolution of a Common-wealth,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8222,"is, ""That every private man has an absolute Propriety in his Goods;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8223,"such, as excludeth the Right of the Soveraign."" Every man has indeed a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8224,Propriety that excludes the Right of every other Subject: And he has it
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8225,"onely from the Soveraign Power; without the protection whereof, every"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8226,other man should have equall Right to the same. But if the Right of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8227,"Soveraign also be excluded, he cannot performe the office they have put"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8228,"him into; which is, to defend them both from forraign enemies, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8229,from the injuries of one another; and consequently there is no longer a
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8230,Common-wealth.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8231,"And if the Propriety of Subjects, exclude not the Right of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8232,Soveraign Representative to their Goods; much lesse to their offices
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8233,"of Judicature, or Execution, in which they Represent the Soveraign"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8234,himselfe.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8235,Dividing Of The Soveraign Power
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8236,"There is a Sixth doctrine, plainly, and directly against the essence"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8237,"of a Common-wealth; and 'tis this, ""That the Soveraign Power may be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8238,"divided."" For what is it to divide the Power of a Common-wealth, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8239,to Dissolve it; for Powers divided mutually destroy each other. And for
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8240,"these doctrines, men are chiefly beholding to some of those, that making"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8241,"profession of the Lawes, endeavour to make them depend upon their own"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8242,"learning, and not upon the Legislative Power."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8243,Imitation Of Neighbour Nations
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8244,"And as False Doctrine, so also often-times the Example of different"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8245,"Government in a neighbouring Nation, disposeth men to alteration of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8246,the forme already setled. So the people of the Jewes were stirred up to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8247,"reject God, and to call upon the Prophet Samuel, for a King after"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8248,"the manner of the Nations; So also the lesser Cities of Greece, were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8249,"continually disturbed, with seditions of the Aristocraticall, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8250,"Democraticall factions; one part of almost every Common-wealth, desiring"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8251,"to imitate the Lacedaemonians; the other, the Athenians. And I doubt"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8252,"not, but many men, have been contented to see the late troubles in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8253,"England, out of an imitation of the Low Countries; supposing there"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8254,"needed no more to grow rich, than to change, as they had done, the forme"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8255,"of their Government. For the constitution of mans nature, is of it selfe"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8256,"subject to desire novelty: When therefore they are provoked to the same,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8257,"by the neighbourhood also of those that have been enriched by it, it is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8258,"almost impossible for them, not to be content with those that solicite"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8259,"them to change; and love the first beginnings, though they be grieved"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8260,"with the continuance of disorder; like hot blouds, that having gotten"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8261,"the itch, tear themselves with their own nayles, till they can endure"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8262,the smart no longer.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8263,"Imitation Of The Greeks, And Romans"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8264,And as to Rebellion in particular against Monarchy; one of the most
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8265,"frequent causes of it, is the Reading of the books of Policy, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8266,"Histories of the antient Greeks, and Romans; from which, young men,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8267,"and all others that are unprovided of the Antidote of solid Reason,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8268,"receiving a strong, and delightfull impression, of the great exploits"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8269,"of warre, atchieved by the Conductors of their Armies, receive withall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8270,"a pleasing Idea, of all they have done besides; and imagine their great"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8271,"prosperity, not to have proceeded from the aemulation of particular men,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8272,but from the vertue of their popular form of government: Not considering
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8273,"the frequent Seditions, and Civill Warres, produced by the imperfection"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8274,"of their Policy. From the reading, I say, of such books, men have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8275,"undertaken to kill their Kings, because the Greek and Latine writers,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8276,"in their books, and discourses of Policy, make it lawfull, and laudable,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8277,"for any man so to do; provided before he do it, he call him Tyrant. For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8278,"they say not Regicide, that is, killing of a King, but Tyrannicide, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8279,"is, killing of a Tyrant is lawfull. From the same books, they that live"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8280,"under a Monarch conceive an opinion, that the Subjects in a Popular"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8281,Common-wealth enjoy Liberty; but that in a Monarchy they are all Slaves.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8282,"I say, they that live under a Monarchy conceive such an opinion; not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8283,they that live under a Popular Government; for they find no such matter.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8284,"In summe, I cannot imagine, how anything can be more prejudiciall to a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8285,"Monarchy, than the allowing of such books to be publikely read, without"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8286,"present applying such correctives of discreet Masters, as are fit to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8287,take away their Venime; Which Venime I will not doubt to compare to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8288,"the biting of a mad Dogge, which is a disease the Physicians call"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8289,"Hydrophobia, or Fear Of Water. For as he that is so bitten, has a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8290,"continuall torment of thirst, and yet abhorreth water; and is in such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8291,"an estate, as if the poyson endeavoured to convert him into a Dogge:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8292,"So when a Monarchy is once bitten to the quick, by those Democraticall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8293,"writers, that continually snarle at that estate; it wanteth nothing"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8294,"more than a strong Monarch, which neverthelesse out of a certain"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8295,"Tyrannophobia, or feare of being strongly governed, when they have him,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8296,they abhorre.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8297,"As here have been Doctors, that hold there be three Soules in a man;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8298,"so there be also that think there may be more Soules, (that is, more"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8299,"Soveraigns,) than one, in a Common-wealth; and set up a Supremacy"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8300,against the Soveraignty; Canons against Lawes; and a Ghostly Authority
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8301,"against the Civill; working on mens minds, with words and distinctions,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8302,"that of themselves signifie nothing, but bewray (by their obscurity)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8303,"that there walketh (as some think invisibly) another Kingdome, as it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8304,"were a Kingdome of Fayries, in the dark. Now seeing it is manifest, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8305,"the Civill Power, and the Power of the Common-wealth is the same"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8306,"thing; and that Supremacy, and the Power of making Canons, and granting"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8307,"Faculties, implyeth a Common-wealth; it followeth, that where one is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8308,"Soveraign, another Supreme; where one can make Lawes, and another"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8309,"make Canons; there must needs be two Common-wealths, of one & the same"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8310,"Subjects; which is a Kingdome divided in it selfe, and cannot stand. For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8311,"notwithstanding the insignificant distinction of Temporall, and Ghostly,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8312,"they are still two Kingdomes, and every Subject is subject to two"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8313,Masters. For seeing the Ghostly Power challengeth the Right to declare
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8314,"what is Sinne it challengeth by consequence to declare what is Law,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8315,"(Sinne being nothing but the transgression of the Law;) and again, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8316,"Civill Power challenging to declare what is Law, every Subject must"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8317,"obey two Masters, who bothe will have their Commands be observed as Law;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8318,"which is impossible. Or, if it be but one Kingdome, either the Civill,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8319,"which is the Power of the Common-wealth, must be subordinate to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8320,Ghostly; or the Ghostly must be subordinate to the Temporall and then
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8321,there is no Supremacy but the Temporall. When therefore these two Powers
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8322,"oppose one another, the Common-wealth cannot but be in great danger"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8323,"of Civill warre, and Dissolution. For the Civill Authority being more"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8324,"visible, and standing in the cleerer light of naturall reason cannot"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8325,choose but draw to it in all times a very considerable part of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8326,"people: And the Spirituall, though it stand in the darknesse of Schoole"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8327,"distinctions, and hard words; yet because the fear of Darknesse, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8328,"Ghosts, is greater than other fears, cannot want a party sufficient to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8329,"Trouble, and sometimes to Destroy a Common-wealth. And this is a Disease"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8330,"which not unfitly may be compared to the Epilepsie, or Falling-sicknesse"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8331,(which the Jewes took to be one kind of possession by Spirits) in the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8332,"Body Naturall. For as in this Disease, there is an unnaturall spirit,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8333,"or wind in the head that obstructeth the roots of the Nerves, and moving"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8334,"them violently, taketh away the motion which naturally they should have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8335,"from the power of the Soule in the Brain, and thereby causeth violent,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8336,and irregular motions (which men call Convulsions) in the parts;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8337,"insomuch as he that is seized therewith, falleth down sometimes into the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8338,"water, and sometimes into the fire, as a man deprived of his senses;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8339,"so also in the Body Politique, when the Spirituall power, moveth the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8340,"Members of a Common-wealth, by the terrour of punishments, and hope of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8341,"rewards (which are the Nerves of it,) otherwise than by the Civill Power"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8342,(which is the Soule of the Common-wealth) they ought to be moved; and by
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8343,"strange, and hard words suffocates the people, and either Overwhelm"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8344,"the Common-wealth with Oppression, or cast it into the Fire of a Civill"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8345,warre.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8346,Mixt Government
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8347,"Sometimes also in the meerly Civill government, there be more than"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8348,"one Soule: As when the Power of levying mony, (which is the Nutritive"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8349,"faculty,) has depended on a generall Assembly; the Power of conduct and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8350,"command, (which is the Motive Faculty,) on one man; and the Power of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8351,"making Lawes, (which is the Rationall faculty,) on the accidentall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8352,"consent, not onely of those two, but also of a third; This endangereth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8353,"the Common-wealth, somtimes for want of consent to good Lawes; but most"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8354,"often for want of such Nourishment, as is necessary to Life, and Motion."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8355,"For although few perceive, that such government, is not government,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8356,"but division of the Common-wealth into three Factions, and call it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8357,"mixt Monarchy; yet the truth is, that it is not one independent"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8358,"Common-wealth, but three independent Factions; nor one Representative"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8359,"Person, but three. In the Kingdome of God, there may be three Persons"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8360,"independent, without breach of unity in God that Reigneth; but where men"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8361,"Reigne, that be subject to diversity of opinions, it cannot be so. And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8362,"therefore if the King bear the person of the People, and the generall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8363,"Assembly bear also the person of the People, and another assembly bear"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8364,"the person of a Part of the people, they are not one Person, nor one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8365,"Soveraign, but three Persons, and three Soveraigns."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8366,"To what Disease in the Naturall Body of man, I may exactly compare this"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8367,"irregularity of a Common-wealth, I know not. But I have seen a man, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8368,"had another man growing out of his side, with an head, armes, breast,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8369,"and stomach, of his own: If he had had another man growing out of his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8370,"other side, the comparison might then have been exact."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8371,Want Of Mony
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8372,"Hitherto I have named such Diseases of a Common-wealth, as are of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8373,"greatest, and most present danger. There be other, not so great; which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8374,"neverthelesse are not unfit to be observed. As first, the difficulty of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8375,"raising Mony, for the necessary uses of the Common-wealth; especially"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8376,"in the approach of warre. This difficulty ariseth from the opinion, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8377,"every Subject hath of a Propriety in his lands and goods, exclusive of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8378,the Soveraigns Right to the use of the same. From whence it commeth to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8379,"passe, that the Soveraign Power, which foreseeth the necessities and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8380,"dangers of the Common-wealth, (finding the passage of mony to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8381,"publique Treasure obstructed, by the tenacity of the people,) whereas"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8382,"it ought to extend it selfe, to encounter, and prevent such dangers in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8383,"their beginnings, contracteth it selfe as long as it can, and when it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8384,"cannot longer, struggles with the people by strategems of Law, to obtain"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8385,"little summes, which not sufficing, he is fain at last violently to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8386,"open the way for present supply, or Perish; and being put often to these"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8387,"extremities, at last reduceth the people to their due temper; or else"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8388,the Common-wealth must perish. Insomuch as we may compare this Distemper
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8389,"very aptly to an Ague; wherein, the fleshy parts being congealed, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8390,by venomous matter obstructed; the Veins which by their naturall course
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8391,"empty themselves into the Heart, are not (as they ought to be) supplyed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8392,"from the Arteries, whereby there succeedeth at first a cold contraction,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8393,"and trembling of the limbes; and afterwards a hot, and strong endeavour"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8394,"of the Heart, to force a passage for the Bloud; and before it can do"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8395,"that, contenteth it selfe with the small refreshments of such things as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8396,"coole of a time, till (if Nature be strong enough) it break at last"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8397,"the contumacy of the parts obstructed, and dissipateth the venome into"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8398,sweat; or (if Nature be too weak) the Patient dyeth.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8399,Monopolies And Abuses Of Publicans
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8400,"Again, there is sometimes in a Common-wealth, a Disease, which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8401,"resembleth the Pleurisie; and that is, when the Treasure of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8402,"Common-wealth, flowing out of its due course, is gathered together in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8403,"too much abundance, in one, or a few private men, by Monopolies, or by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8404,Farmes of the Publique Revenues; in the same manner as the Blood in a
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8405,"Pleurisie, getting into the Membrane of the breast, breedeth there an"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8406,"Inflammation, accompanied with a Fever, and painfull stitches."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8407,Popular Men
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8408,"Also, the Popularity of a potent Subject, (unlesse the Common-wealth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8409,"have very good caution of his fidelity,) is a dangerous Disease; because"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8410,the people (which should receive their motion from the Authority of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8411,"Soveraign,) by the flattery, and by the reputation of an ambitious man,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8412,"are drawn away from their obedience to the Lawes, to follow a man, of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8413,"whose vertues, and designes they have no knowledge. And this is commonly"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8414,"of more danger in a Popular Government, than in a Monarchy; as it may"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8415,"easily be made believe, they are the People. By this means it was, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8416,"Julius Caesar, who was set up by the People against the Senate, having"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8417,"won to himselfe the affections of his Army, made himselfe Master, both"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8418,"of Senate and People. And this proceeding of popular, and ambitious men,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8419,is plain Rebellion; and may be resembled to the effects of Witchcraft.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8420,"Excessive Greatnesse Of A Town, Multitude Of Corporations"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8421,"Another infirmity of a Common-wealth, is the immoderate greatnesse of a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8422,"Town, when it is able to furnish out of its own Circuit, the number, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8423,expence of a great Army: As also the great number of Corporations; which
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8424,"are as it were many lesser Common-wealths in the bowels of a greater,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8425,like wormes in the entrayles of a naturall man.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8426,Liberty Of Disputing Against Soveraign Power
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8427,"To which may be added, the Liberty of Disputing against absolute Power,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8428,by pretenders to Politicall Prudence; which though bred for the most
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8429,"part in the Lees of the people; yet animated by False Doctrines, are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8430,"perpetually medling with the Fundamentall Lawes, to the molestation"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8431,"of the Common-wealth; like the little Wormes, which Physicians call"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8432,Ascarides.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8433,"We may further adde, the insatiable appetite, or Bulimia, of enlarging"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8434,Dominion; with the incurable Wounds thereby many times received from
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8435,"the enemy; And the Wens, of ununited conquests, which are many times a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8436,"burthen, and with lesse danger lost, than kept; As also the Lethargy of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8437,"Ease, and Consumption of Riot and Vain Expence."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8438,Dissolution Of The Common-wealth
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8439,"Lastly, when in a warre (forraign, or intestine,) the enemies got a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8440,final Victory; so as (the forces of the Common-wealth keeping the field
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8441,no longer) there is no farther protection of Subjects in their loyalty;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8442,"then is the Common-wealth DISSOLVED, and every man at liberty to protect"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8443,himselfe by such courses as his own discretion shall suggest unto him.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8444,"For the Soveraign, is the publique Soule, giving Life and Motion to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8445,"Common-wealth; which expiring, the Members are governed by it no more,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8446,"than the Carcasse of a man, by his departed (though Immortal) Soule. For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8447,though the Right of a Soveraign Monarch cannot be extinguished by the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8448,act of another; yet the Obligation of the members may. For he that
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8449,"wants protection, may seek it anywhere; and when he hath it, is obliged"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8450,"(without fraudulent pretence of having submitted himselfe out of fear,)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8451,to protect his Protection as long as he is able. But when the Power of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8452,"an Assembly is once suppressed, the Right of the same perisheth utterly;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8453,"because the Assembly it selfe is extinct; and consequently, there is no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,29,8454,possibility for the Soveraignty to re-enter.

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8456,The Procuration Of The Good Of The People
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8457,"The OFFICE of the Soveraign, (be it a Monarch, or an Assembly,)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8458,"consisteth in the end, for which he was trusted with the Soveraign"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8459,"Power, namely the procuration of the Safety Of The People; to which he"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8466,"And this is intended should be done, not by care applyed to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8467,"Individualls, further than their protection from injuries, when they"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8472,Against The Duty Of A Soveraign To Relinquish Any Essentiall Right
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8473,of Soveraignty Or Not To See The People Taught The Grounds Of Them
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8474,"And because, if the essentiall Rights of Soveraignty (specified before"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8475,"in the eighteenth Chapter) be taken away, the Common-wealth is thereby"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8477,"warre with every other man, (which is the greatest evill that can happen"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8478,"in this life;) it is the Office of the Soveraign, to maintain those"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8479,"Rights entire; and consequently against his duty, First, to transferre"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8480,"to another, or to lay from himselfe any of them. For he that deserteth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8481,"the Means, deserteth the Ends; and he deserteth the Means, that being"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8482,"the Soveraign, acknowledgeth himselfe subject to the Civill Lawes; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8483,"renounceth the Power of Supreme Judicature; or of making Warre, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8484,Peace by his own Authority; or of Judging of the Necessities of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8485,"Common-wealth; or of levying Mony, and Souldiers, when, and as much as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8486,"in his own conscience he shall judge necessary; or of making Officers,"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8489,"Peace, and Good of the people. Secondly, it is against his duty, to let"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8490,"the people be ignorant, or mis-in-formed of the grounds, and reasons"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8491,of those his essentiall Rights; because thereby men are easie to be

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8494,"And the grounds of these Rights, have the rather need to be diligently,"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8496,"or terrour of legal punishment. For a Civill Law, that shall forbid"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8497,"Rebellion, (and such is all resistance to the essentiall Rights of"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8499,"onely of the Law of Nature, that forbiddeth the violation of Faith;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8500,"which naturall obligation if men know not, they cannot know the Right of"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8504,Objection Of Those That Say There Are No Principles Of Reason For

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8506,"As I have heard some say, that Justice is but a word, without substance;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8507,"and that whatsoever a man can by force, or art, acquire to himselfe,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8508,"(not onely in the condition of warre, but also in a Common-wealth,) is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8509,"his own, which I have already shewed to be false: So there be also"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8511,"sustain those essentiall Rights, which make Soveraignty absolute. For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8512,"if there were, they would have been found out in some place, or other;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8513,"whereas we see, there has not hitherto been any Common-wealth, where"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8514,"those Rights have been acknowledged, or challenged. Wherein they argue"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8523,"constitute Common-wealths, imperfect, and apt to relapse into disorder,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8524,"there may, Principles of Reason be found out, by industrious meditation,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8525,"to make use of them, or be neglected by them, or not, concerneth my"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8526,"particular interest, at this day, very little. But supposing that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8527,these of mine are not such Principles of Reason; yet I am sure they are
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8528,"Principles from Authority of Scripture; as I shall make it appear, when"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8529,"I shall come to speak of the Kingdome of God, (administred by Moses,)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8530,"over the Jewes, his peculiar people by Covenant."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8531,Objection From The Incapacity Of The Vulgar
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8532,"But they say again, that though the Principles be right, yet Common"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8533,people are not of capacity enough to be made to understand them. I
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8534,"should be glad, that the Rich, and Potent Subjects of a Kingdome, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8535,"those that are accounted the most Learned, were no lesse incapable than"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8536,"they. But all men know, that the obstructions to this kind of doctrine,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8537,"proceed not so much from the difficulty of the matter, as from the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8538,"interest of them that are to learn. Potent men, digest hardly any thing"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8539,"that setteth up a Power to bridle their affections; and Learned men,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8540,"any thing that discovereth their errours, and thereby lesseneth their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8541,"Authority: whereas the Common-peoples minds, unlesse they be tainted"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8542,"with dependance on the Potent, or scribbled over with the opinions"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8543,"of their Doctors, are like clean paper, fit to receive whatsoever by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8544,Publique Authority shall be imprinted in them. Shall whole Nations be
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8545,"brought to Acquiesce in the great Mysteries of Christian Religion, which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8546,"are above Reason; and millions of men be made believe, that the same"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8547,"Body may be in innumerable places, at one and the same time, which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8548,"is against Reason; and shall not men be able, by their teaching, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8549,"preaching, protected by the Law, to make that received, which is so"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8550,"consonant to Reason, that any unprejudicated man, needs no more to learn"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8551,"it, than to hear it? I conclude therefore, that in the instruction"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8552,"of the people in the Essentiall Rights (which are the Naturall, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8553,"Fundamentall Lawes) of Soveraignty, there is no difficulty, (whilest a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8554,"Soveraign has his Power entire,) but what proceeds from his own fault,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8555,or the fault of those whom he trusteth in the administration of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8556,"Common-wealth; and consequently, it is his Duty, to cause them so to be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8557,"instructed; and not onely his Duty, but his Benefit also, and Security,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8558,"against the danger that may arrive to himselfe in his naturall Person,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8559,from Rebellion.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8560,"Subjects Are To Be Taught, Not To Affect Change Of Government"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8561,"And (to descend to particulars) the People are to be taught, First, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8562,they ought not to be in love with any forme of Government they see
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8563,"in their neighbour Nations, more than with their own, nor (whatsoever"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8564,present prosperity they behold in Nations that are otherwise governed
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8565,"than they,) to desire change. For the prosperity of a People ruled by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8566,"an Aristocraticall, or Democraticall assembly, commeth not from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8567,"Aristocracy, nor from Democracy, but from the Obedience, and Concord of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8568,"the Subjects; nor do the people flourish in a Monarchy, because one man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8569,"has the right to rule them, but because they obey him. Take away in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8570,"any kind of State, the Obedience, (and consequently the Concord of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8571,"People,) and they shall not onely not flourish, but in short time be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8572,"dissolved. And they that go about by disobedience, to doe no more than"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8573,"reforme the Common-wealth, shall find they do thereby destroy it; like"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8574,the foolish daughters of Peleus (in the fable;) which desiring to renew
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8575,"the youth of their decrepit Father, did by the Counsell of Medea, cut"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8576,"him in pieces, and boyle him, together with strange herbs, but made not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8577,"of him a new man. This desire of change, is like the breach of the first"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8578,"of Gods Commandements: For there God says, Non Habebis Deos Alienos;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8579,Thou shalt not have the Gods of other Nations; and in another place
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8580,"concerning Kings, that they are Gods."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8581,Nor Adhere (Against The Soveraign) To Popular Men
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8582,"Secondly, they are to be taught, that they ought not to be led with"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8583,"admiration of the vertue of any of their fellow Subjects, how"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8584,"high soever he stand, nor how conspicuously soever he shine in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8585,"Common-wealth; nor of any Assembly, (except the Soveraign Assembly,)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8586,"so as to deferre to them any obedience, or honour, appropriate to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8587,"Soveraign onely, whom (in their particular stations) they represent; nor"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8588,"to receive any influence from them, but such as is conveighed by them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8589,"from the Soveraign Authority. For that Soveraign, cannot be imagined to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8590,"love his People as he ought, that is not Jealous of them, but suffers"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8591,"them by the flattery of Popular men, to be seduced from their loyalty,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8592,"as they have often been, not onely secretly, but openly, so as to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8593,proclaime Marriage with them In Facie Ecclesiae by Preachers; and by
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8594,publishing the same in the open streets: which may fitly be compared to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8595,the violation of the second of the ten Commandements.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8596,Nor To Dispute The Soveraign Power
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8597,"Thirdly, in consequence to this, they ought to be informed, how great"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8598,"fault it is, to speak evill of the Soveraign Representative, (whether"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8599,"One man, or an Assembly of men;) or to argue and dispute his Power, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8600,"any way to use his Name irreverently, whereby he may be brought into"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8601,"Contempt with his People, and their Obedience (in which the safety"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8602,of the Common-wealth consisteth) slackened. Which doctrine the third
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8603,Commandement by resemblance pointeth to.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8604,And To Have Dayes Set Apart To Learn Their Duty
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8605,"Fourthly, seeing people cannot be taught this, nor when 'tis taught,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8606,"remember it, nor after one generation past, so much as know in whom the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8607,"Soveraign Power is placed, without setting a part from their ordinary"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8608,"labour, some certain times, in which they may attend those that are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8609,appointed to instruct them; It is necessary that some such times be
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8610,"determined, wherein they may assemble together, and (after prayers and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8611,"praises given to God, the Soveraign of Soveraigns) hear those their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8612,"Duties told them, and the Positive Lawes, such as generally concern them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8613,"all, read and expounded, and be put in mind of the Authority that maketh"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8614,"them Lawes. To this end had the Jewes every seventh day, a Sabbath, in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8615,which the Law was read and expounded; and in the solemnity whereof they
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8616,"were put in mind, that their King was God; that having created the world"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8617,"in six days, he rested the seventh day; and by their resting on it from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8618,"their labour, that that God was their King, which redeemed them from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8619,"their servile, and painfull labour in Egypt, and gave them a time, after"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8620,"they had rejoyced in God, to take joy also in themselves, by lawfull"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8621,"recreation. So that the first Table of the Commandements, is spent all,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8622,"in setting down the summe of Gods absolute Power; not onely as God,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8623,"but as King by pact, (in peculiar) of the Jewes; and may therefore give"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8624,"light, to those that have the Soveraign Power conferred on them by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8625,"consent of men, to see what doctrine they Ought to teach their Subjects."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8626,And To Honour Their Parents
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8627,"And because the first instruction of Children, dependeth on the care"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8628,"of their Parents; it is necessary that they should be obedient to them,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8629,"whilest they are under their tuition; and not onely so, but that also"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8630,"afterwards (as gratitude requireth,) they acknowledge the benefit of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8631,"their education, by externall signes of honour. To which end they are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8632,"to be taught, that originally the Father of every man was also his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8633,"Soveraign Lord, with power over him of life and death; and that the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8634,"Fathers of families, when by instituting a Common-wealth, they resigned"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8635,"that absolute Power, yet it was never intended, they should lose the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8636,"honour due unto them for their education. For to relinquish such right,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8637,was not necessary to the Institution of Soveraign Power; nor would there
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8638,"be any reason, why any man should desire to have children, or take the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8639,"care to nourish, and instruct them, if they were afterwards to have no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8640,"other benefit from them, than from other men. And this accordeth with"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8641,the fifth Commandement.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8642,And To Avoyd Doing Of Injury:
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8643,"Again, every Soveraign Ought to cause Justice to be taught, which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8644,"(consisting in taking from no man what is his) is as much as to say, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8645,"cause men to be taught not to deprive their Neighbour, by violence,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8646,"or fraud, of any thing which by the Soveraign Authority is theirs. Of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8647,"things held in propriety, those that are dearest to a man are his own"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8648,"life, & limbs; and in the next degree, (in most men,) those that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8649,concern conjugall affection; and after them riches and means of living.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8650,"Therefore the People are to be taught, to abstain from violence to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8651,"one anothers person, by private revenges; from violation of conjugall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8652,"honour; and from forcibly rapine, and fraudulent surreption of one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8653,anothers goods. For which purpose also it is necessary they be shewed
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8654,"the evill consequences of false Judgement, by corruption either of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8655,"Judges or Witnesses, whereby the distinction of propriety is taken away,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8656,and Justice becomes of no effect: all which things are intimated in the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8657,"sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth Commandements."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8658,And To Do All This Sincerely From The Heart
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8659,"Lastly, they are to be taught, that not onely the unjust facts, but the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8660,"designes and intentions to do them, (though by accident hindred,) are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8661,"Injustice; which consisteth in the pravity of the will, as well as in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8662,the irregularity of the act. And this is the intention of the tenth
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8663,"Commandement, and the summe of the Second Table; which is reduced all to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8664,"this one Commandement of mutuall Charity, ""Thou shalt love thy neighbour"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8665,"as thy selfe:"" as the summe of the first Table is reduced to ""the love"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8666,"of God;"" whom they had then newly received as their King."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8667,The Use Of Universities
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8668,"As for the Means, and Conduits, by which the people may receive this"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8669,"Instruction, wee are to search, by what means so may Opinions,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8670,"contrary to the peace of Man-kind, upon weak and false Principles, have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8671,"neverthelesse been so deeply rooted in them. I mean those, which I have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8672,in the precedent Chapter specified: as That men shall Judge of what is
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8673,"lawfull and unlawfull, not by the Law it selfe, but by their own"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8674,private Judgements; That Subjects sinne in obeying the Commands of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8675,"Common-wealth, unlesse they themselves have first judged them to be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8676,"lawfull: That their Propriety in their riches is such, as to exclude the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8677,"Dominion, which the Common-wealth hath over the same: That it is lawfull"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8678,"for Subjects to kill such, as they call Tyrants: That the Soveraign"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8679,"Power may be divided, and the like; which come to be instilled into"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8680,"the People by this means. They whom necessity, or covetousnesse keepeth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8681,"attent on their trades, and labour; and they, on the other side, whom"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8682,"superfluity, or sloth carrieth after their sensuall pleasures, (which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8683,"two sorts of men take up the greatest part of Man-kind,) being diverted"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8684,"from the deep meditation, which the learning of truth, not onely in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8685,"matter of Naturall Justice, but also of all other Sciences necessarily"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8686,"requireth, receive the Notions of their duty, chiefly from Divines"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8687,"in the Pulpit, and partly from such of their Neighbours, or familiar"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8688,"acquaintance, as having the Faculty of discoursing readily, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8689,"plausibly, seem wiser and better learned in cases of Law, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8690,"Conscience, than themselves. And the Divines, and such others as make"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8691,"shew of Learning, derive their knowledge from the Universities, and from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8692,"the Schooles of Law, or from the Books, which by men eminent in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8693,"those Schooles, and Universities have been published. It is therefore"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8694,"manifest, that the Instruction of the people, dependeth wholly, on the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8695,right teaching of Youth in the Universities. But are not (may some men
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8696,say) the Universities of England learned enough already to do that? or
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8697,is it you will undertake to teach the Universities? Hard questions. Yet
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8698,"to the first, I doubt not to answer; that till towards the later end of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8699,"Henry the Eighth, the Power of the Pope, was alwayes upheld against the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8700,"Power of the Common-wealth, principally by the Universities; and that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8701,"the doctrines maintained by so many Preachers, against the Soveraign"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8702,"Power of the King, and by so many Lawyers, and others, that had their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8703,"education there, is a sufficient argument, that though the Universities"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8704,"were not authors of those false doctrines, yet they knew not how to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8705,"plant the true. For in such a contradiction of Opinions, it is most"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8706,"certain, that they have not been sufficiently instructed; and 'tis no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8707,"wonder, if they yet retain a relish of that subtile liquor, wherewith"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8708,"they were first seasoned, against the Civill Authority. But to the later"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8709,"question, it is not fit, nor needfull for me to say either I, or No: for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8710,"any man that sees what I am doing, may easily perceive what I think."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8711,"The safety of the People, requireth further, from him, or them that have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8712,"the Soveraign Power, that Justice be equally administred to all degrees"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8713,"of People; that is, that as well the rich, and mighty, as poor and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8714,"obscure persons, may be righted of the injuries done them; so as the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8715,"great, may have no greater hope of impunity, when they doe violence,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8716,"dishonour, or any Injury to the meaner sort, than when one of these,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8717,"does the like to one of them: For in this consisteth Equity; to which,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8718,"as being a Precept of the Law of Nature, a Soveraign is as much subject,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8719,"as any of the meanest of his People. All breaches of the Law, are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8720,"offences against the Common-wealth: but there be some, that are also"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8721,"against private Persons. Those that concern the Common-wealth onely, may"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8722,without breach of Equity be pardoned; for every man may pardon what is
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8723,"done against himselfe, according to his own discretion. But an offence"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8724,"against a private man, cannot in Equity be pardoned, without the consent"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8725,of him that is injured; or reasonable satisfaction.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8726,"The Inequality of Subjects, proceedeth from the Acts of Soveraign Power;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8727,and therefore has no more place in the presence of the Soveraign; that
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8728,"is to say, in a Court of Justice, then the Inequality between Kings,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8729,"and their Subjects, in the presence of the King of Kings. The honour of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8730,"great Persons, is to be valued for their beneficence, and the aydes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8731,"they give to men of inferiour rank, or not at all. And the violences,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8732,"oppressions, and injuries they do, are not extenuated, but aggravated by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8733,the greatnesse of their persons; because they have least need to commit
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8734,"them. The consequences of this partiality towards the great, proceed in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8735,"this manner. Impunity maketh Insolence; Insolence Hatred; and Hatred,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8736,"an Endeavour to pull down all oppressing and contumelious greatnesse,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8737,though with the ruine of the Common-wealth.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8738,Equall Taxes
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8739,"To Equall Justice, appertaineth also the Equall imposition of Taxes;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8740,"the equality whereof dependeth not on the Equality of riches, but on the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8741,"Equality of the debt, that every man oweth to the Common-wealth for his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8742,"defence. It is not enough, for a man to labour for the maintenance"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8743,"of his life; but also to fight, (if need be,) for the securing of his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8744,labour. They must either do as the Jewes did after their return from
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8745,"captivity, in re-edifying the Temple, build with one hand, and hold the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8746,Sword in the other; or else they must hire others to fight for them. For
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8747,"the Impositions that are layd on the People by the Soveraign Power, are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8748,"nothing else but the Wages, due to them that hold the publique Sword,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8749,"to defend private men in the exercise of severall Trades, and Callings."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8750,"Seeing then the benefit that every one receiveth thereby, is the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8751,"enjoyment of life, which is equally dear to poor, and rich; the debt"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8752,"which a poor man oweth them that defend his life, is the same which a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8753,"rich man oweth for the defence of his; saving that the rich, who have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8754,"the service of the poor, may be debtors not onely for their own persons,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8755,"but for many more. Which considered, the Equality of Imposition,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8756,"consisteth rather in the Equality of that which is consumed, than of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8757,"riches of the persons that consume the same. For what reason is there,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8758,"that he which laboureth much, and sparing the fruits of his labour,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8759,"consumeth little, should be more charged, then he that living idlely,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8760,"getteth little, and spendeth all he gets; seeing the one hath no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8761,"more protection from the Common-wealth, then the other? But when the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8762,"Impositions, are layd upon those things which men consume, every man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8763,"payeth Equally for what he useth: Nor is the Common-wealth defrauded, by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8764,the luxurious waste of private men.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8765,Publique Charity
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8766,"And whereas many men, by accident unevitable, become unable to maintain"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8767,themselves by their labour; they ought not to be left to the Charity
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8768,"of private persons; but to be provided for, (as far-forth as the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8769,"necessities of Nature require,) by the Lawes of the Common-wealth. For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8770,"as it is Uncharitablenesse in any man, to neglect the impotent; so it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8771,"is in the Soveraign of a Common-wealth, to expose them to the hazard of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8772,such uncertain Charity.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8773,Prevention Of Idlenesse
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8774,"But for such as have strong bodies, the case is otherwise: they are to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8775,"be forced to work; and to avoyd the excuse of not finding employment,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8776,"there ought to be such Lawes, as may encourage all manner of Arts; as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8777,"Navigation, Agriculture, Fishing, and all manner of Manifacture that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8778,"requires labour. The multitude of poor, and yet strong people still"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8779,"encreasing, they are to be transplanted into Countries not sufficiently"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8780,"inhabited: where neverthelesse, they are not to exterminate those they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8781,"find there; but constrain them to inhabit closer together, and not range"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8782,"a great deal of ground, to snatch what they find; but to court each"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8783,"little Plot with art and labour, to give them their sustenance in due"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8784,"season. And when all the world is overchargd with Inhabitants, then the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8785,"last remedy of all is Warre; which provideth for every man, by Victory,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8786,or Death.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8787,Good Lawes What
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8788,"To the care of the Soveraign, belongeth the making of Good Lawes. But"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8789,"what is a good Law? By a Good Law, I mean not a Just Law: for no Law can"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8790,"be Unjust. The Law is made by the Soveraign Power, and all that is done"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8791,"by such Power, is warranted, and owned by every one of the people; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8792,"that which every man will have so, no man can say is unjust. It is in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8793,"the Lawes of a Common-wealth, as in the Lawes of Gaming: whatsoever"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8794,"the Gamesters all agree on, is Injustice to none of them. A good Law"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8795,"is that, which is Needfull, for the Good Of The People, and withall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8796,Perspicuous.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8797,Such As Are Necessary
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8798,"For the use of Lawes, (which are but Rules Authorised) is not to bind"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8799,the People from all Voluntary actions; but to direct and keep them in
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8800,"such a motion, as not to hurt themselves by their own impetuous desires,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8801,"rashnesse, or indiscretion, as Hedges are set, not to stop Travellers,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8802,"but to keep them in the way. And therefore a Law that is not Needfull,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8803,"having not the true End of a Law, is not Good. A Law may be conceived to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8804,"be Good, when it is for the benefit of the Soveraign; though it be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8805,not Necessary for the People; but it is not so. For the good of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8806,"Soveraign and People, cannot be separated. It is a weak Soveraign, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8807,"has weak Subjects; and a weak People, whose Soveraign wanteth Power to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8808,rule them at his will. Unnecessary Lawes are not good Lawes; but trapps
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8809,"for Mony: which where the right of Soveraign Power is acknowledged, are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8810,"superfluous; and where it is not acknowledged, unsufficient to defend"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8811,the People.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8812,Such As Are Perspicuous
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8813,"The Perspicuity, consisteth not so much in the words of the Law it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8814,"selfe, as in a Declaration of the Causes, and Motives, for which it was"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8815,"made. That is it, that shewes us the meaning of the Legislator, and the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8816,"meaning of the Legislator known, the Law is more easily understood"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8817,"by few, than many words. For all words, are subject to ambiguity;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8818,"and therefore multiplication of words in the body of the Law, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8819,"multiplication of ambiguity: Besides it seems to imply, (by too much"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8820,"diligence,) that whosoever can evade the words, is without the compasse"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8821,of the Law. And this is a cause of many unnecessary Processes. For when
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8822,I consider how short were the Lawes of antient times; and how they
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8823,grew by degrees still longer; me thinks I see a contention between the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8824,"Penners, and Pleaders of the Law; the former seeking to circumscribe"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8825,the later; and the later to evade their circumscriptions; and that the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8826,Pleaders have got the Victory. It belongeth therefore to the Office of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8827,"a Legislator, (such as is in all Common-wealths the Supreme"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8828,"Representative, be it one Man, or an Assembly,) to make the reason"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8829,"Perspicuous, why the Law was made; and the Body of the Law it selfe, as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8830,"short, but in as proper, and significant termes, as may be."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8831,Punishments
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8832,"It belongeth also to the Office of the Soveraign, to make a right"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8833,"application of Punishments, and Rewards. And seeing the end of punishing"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8834,"is not revenge, and discharge of choler; but correction, either of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8835,"offender, or of others by his example; the severest Punishments are to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8836,"be inflicted for those Crimes, that are of most Danger to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8837,Publique; such as are those which proceed from malice to the Government
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8838,established; those that spring from contempt of Justice; those that
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8839,"provoke Indignation in the Multitude; and those, which unpunished, seem"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8840,"Authorised, as when they are committed by Sonnes, Servants, or Favorites"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8841,"of men in Authority: For Indignation carrieth men, not onely against the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8842,"Actors, and Authors of Injustice; but against all Power that is likely"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8843,to protect them; as in the case of Tarquin; when for the Insolent act of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8844,"one of his Sonnes, he was driven out of Rome, and the Monarchy it selfe"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8845,dissolved. But Crimes of Infirmity; such as are those which proceed
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8846,"from great provocation, from great fear, great need, or from ignorance"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8847,"whether the Fact be a great Crime, or not, there is place many times for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8848,"Lenity, without prejudice to the Common-wealth; and Lenity when there is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8849,"such place for it, is required by the Law of Nature. The Punishment of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8850,"the Leaders, and teachers in a Commotion; not the poore seduced People,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8851,"when they are punished, can profit the Common-wealth by their example."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8852,"To be severe to the People, is to punish that ignorance, which may in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8853,"great part be imputed to the Soveraign, whose fault it was, they were no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8854,better instructed.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8855,Rewards
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8856,"In like manner it belongeth to the Office, and Duty of the Soveraign,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8857,"to apply his Rewards alwayes so, as there may arise from them benefit"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8858,"to the Common-wealth: wherein consisteth their Use, and End; and is then"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8859,"done, when they that have well served the Common-wealth, are with"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8860,"as little expence of the Common Treasure, as is possible, so well"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8861,"recompenced, as others thereby may be encouraged, both to serve the same"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8862,"as faithfully as they can, and to study the arts by which they may be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8863,"enabled to do it better. To buy with Mony, or Preferment, from a Popular"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8864,"ambitious Subject, to be quiet, and desist from making ill impressions"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8865,"in the mindes of the People, has nothing of the nature of Reward; (which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8866,"is ordained not for disservice, but for service past;) nor a signe of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8867,"Gratitude, but of Fear: nor does it tend to the Benefit, but to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8868,"Dammage of the Publique. It is a contention with Ambition, like that of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8869,"Hercules with the Monster Hydra, which having many heads, for every one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8870,"that was vanquished, there grew up three. For in like manner, when the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8871,"stubbornnesse of one Popular man, is overcome with Reward, there arise"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8872,"many more (by the Example) that do the same Mischiefe, in hope of like"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8873,"Benefit: and as all sorts of Manifacture, so also Malice encreaseth by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8874,"being vendible. And though sometimes a Civill warre, may be differred,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8875,"by such wayes as that, yet the danger growes still the greater, and the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8876,Publique ruine more assured. It is therefore against the Duty of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8877,"Soveraign, to whom the Publique Safety is committed, to Reward those"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8878,"that aspire to greatnesse by disturbing the Peace of their Country, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8879,"not rather to oppose the beginnings of such men, with a little danger,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8880,than after a longer time with greater.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8881,Counsellours
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8882,"Another Businesse of the Soveraign, is to choose good Counsellours;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8883,"I mean such, whose advice he is to take in the Government of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8884,"Common-wealth. For this word Counsell, Consilium, corrupted from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8885,"Considium, is a large signification, and comprehendeth all Assemblies"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8886,"of men that sit together, not onely to deliberate what is to be done"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8887,"hereafter, but also to judge of Facts past, and of Law for the present."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8888,"I take it here in the first sense onely: And in this sense, there is no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8889,"choyce of Counsell, neither in a Democracy, nor Aristocracy; because the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8890,persons Counselling are members of the person Counselled. The choyce
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8891,"of Counsellours therefore is to Monarchy; In which, the Soveraign that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8892,"endeavoureth not to make choyce of those, that in every kind are the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8893,"most able, dischargeth not his Office as he ought to do. The most able"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8894,"Counsellours, are they that have least hope of benefit by giving evill"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8895,"Counsell, and most knowledge of those things that conduce to the Peace,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8896,and Defence of the Common-wealth. It is a hard matter to know who
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8897,expecteth benefit from publique troubles; but the signes that guide to a
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8898,"just suspicion, is the soothing of the people in their unreasonable,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8899,"or irremediable grievances, by men whose estates are not sufficient to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8900,"discharge their accustomed expences, and may easily be observed by any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8901,"one whom it concerns to know it. But to know, who has most knowledge of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8902,"the Publique affaires, is yet harder; and they that know them, need them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8903,"a great deale the lesse. For to know, who knowes the Rules almost of any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8904,"Art, is a great degree of the knowledge of the same Art; because no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8905,"man can be assured of the truth of anothers Rules, but he that is first"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8906,taught to understand them. But the best signes of Knowledge of any
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8907,"Art, are, much conversing in it, and constant good effects of it. Good"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8908,"Counsell comes not by Lot, nor by Inheritance; and therefore there is no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8909,"more reason to expect good Advice from the rich, or noble, in matter"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8910,"of State, than in delineating the dimensions of a fortresse; unlesse we"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8911,"shall think there needs no method in the study of the Politiques, (as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8912,"there does in the study of Geometry,) but onely to be lookers on; which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8913,is not so. For the Politiques is the harder study of the two. Whereas
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8914,"in these parts of Europe, it hath been taken for a Right of certain"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8915,"persons, to have place in the highest Councell of State by Inheritance;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8916,it is derived from the Conquests of the antient Germans; wherein many
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8917,"absolute Lords joyning together to conquer other Nations, would not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8918,"enter in to the Confederacy, without such Priviledges, as might be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8919,"marks of difference in time following, between their Posterity, and the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8920,posterity of their Subjects; which Priviledges being inconsistent with
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8921,"the Soveraign Power, by the favour of the Soveraign, they may seem to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8922,"keep; but contending for them as their Right, they must needs by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8923,"degrees let them go, and have at last no further honour, than adhaereth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8924,naturally to their abilities.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8925,"And how able soever be the Counsellours in any affaire, the benefit"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8926,"of their Counsell is greater, when they give every one his Advice, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8927,"reasons of it apart, than when they do it in an Assembly, by way of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8928,"Orations; and when they have praemeditated, than when they speak on the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8929,"sudden; both because they have more time, to survey the consequences"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8930,"of action; and are lesse subject to be carried away to contradiction,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8931,"through Envy, Emulation, or other Passions arising from the difference"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8932,of opinion.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8933,"The best Counsell, in those things that concern not other Nations, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8934,"onely the ease, and benefit the Subjects may enjoy, by Lawes that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8935,"look onely inward, is to be taken from the generall informations, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8936,"complaints of the people of each Province, who are best acquainted"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8937,"with their own wants, and ought therefore, when they demand nothing in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8938,"derogation of the essentiall Rights of Soveraignty, to be diligently"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8939,"taken notice of. For without those Essentiall Rights, (as I have often"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8940,"before said,) the Common-wealth cannot at all subsist."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8941,Commanders
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8942,"A Commander of an Army in chiefe, if he be not Popular, shall not be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8943,"beloved, nor feared as he ought to be by his Army; and consequently"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8944,cannot performe that office with good successe. He must therefore be
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8945,"Industrious, Valiant, Affable, Liberall and Fortunate, that he may gain"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8946,"an opinion both of sufficiency, and of loving his Souldiers. This is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8947,"Popularity, and breeds in the Souldiers both desire, and courage, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8948,recommend themselves to his favour; and protects the severity of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8949,"the Generall, in punishing (when need is) the Mutinous, or negligent"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8950,"Souldiers. But this love of Souldiers, (if caution be not given of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8951,"the Commanders fidelity,) is a dangerous thing to Soveraign Power;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8952,especially when it is in the hands of an Assembly not popular. It
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8953,"belongeth therefore to the safety of the People, both that they be good"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8954,"Conductors, and faithfull subjects, to whom the Soveraign Commits his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8955,Armies.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8956,"But when the Soveraign himselfe is Popular, that is, reverenced and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8957,"beloved of his People, there is no danger at all from the Popularity of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8958,"a Subject. For Souldiers are never so generally unjust, as to side with"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8959,"their Captain; though they love him, against their Soveraign, when they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8960,"love not onely his Person, but also his Cause. And therefore those,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8961,who by violence have at any time suppressed the Power of their Lawfull
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8962,"Soveraign, before they could settle themselves in his place, have been"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8965,"Soveraign Power, is so popular a quality, as he that has it needs no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8966,"more, for his own part, to turn the hearts of his Subjects to him, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8967,"that they see him able absolutely to govern his own Family: Nor, on the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8968,"part of his enemies, but a disbanding of their Armies. For the greatest"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8969,"and most active part of Mankind, has never hetherto been well contented"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8970,with the present.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8971,"Concerning the Offices of one Soveraign to another, which are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8972,"comprehended in that Law, which is commonly called the Law of Nations,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8973,"I need not say any thing in this place; because the Law of Nations, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8974,"the Law of Nature, is the same thing. And every Soveraign hath the same"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8975,"Right, in procuring the safety of his People, that any particular man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8976,"can have, in procuring the safety of his own Body. And the same Law,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8977,"that dictateth to men that have no Civil Government, what they ought to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8978,"do, and what to avoyd in regard of one another, dictateth the same to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8979,"Common-wealths, that is, to the Consciences of Soveraign Princes, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8980,"Soveraign Assemblies; there being no Court of Naturall Justice, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8981,"in the Conscience onely; where not Man, but God raigneth; whose Lawes,"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8983,"Author of Nature, are Naturall; and in respect of the same God, as he is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8984,"King of Kings, are Lawes. But of the Kingdome of God, as King of Kings,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8985,"and as King also of a peculiar People, I shall speak in the rest of this"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,30,8986,discourse.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,8987,CHAPTER XXXI. OF THE KINGDOME OF GOD BY NATURE
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,8988,The Scope Of The Following Chapters
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,8989,"That the condition of meer Nature, that is to say, of absolute Liberty,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,8990,"such as is theirs, that neither are Soveraigns, nor Subjects, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,8991,"Anarchy, and the condition of Warre: That the Praecepts, by which men"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,8992,"are guided to avoyd that condition, are the Lawes of Nature: That"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,8993,"a Common-wealth, without Soveraign Power, is but a word, without"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,8994,"substance, and cannot stand: That Subjects owe to Soveraigns, simple"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,8995,"Obedience, in all things, wherein their obedience is not repugnant"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,8996,"to the Lawes of God, I have sufficiently proved, in that which I have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,8997,"already written. There wants onely, for the entire knowledge of Civill"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,8998,"duty, to know what are those Lawes of God. For without that, a man knows"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,8999,"not, when he is commanded any thing by the Civill Power, whether it be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9000,"contrary to the Law of God, or not: and so, either by too much civill"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9001,"obedience, offends the Divine Majesty, or through feare of offending"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9002,"God, transgresses the commandements of the Common-wealth. To avoyd both"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9003,"these Rocks, it is necessary to know what are the Lawes Divine. And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9004,"seeing the knowledge of all Law, dependeth on the knowledge of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9005,"Soveraign Power; I shall say something in that which followeth, of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9006,KINGDOME OF GOD.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9007,Who Are Subjects In The Kingdome Of God
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9008,"""God is King, let the Earth rejoice,"" saith the Psalmist. (Psal. 96. 1)."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9009,"And again, ""God is King though the Nations be angry; and he that sitteth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9010,"on the Cherubins, though the earth be moved."" (Psal. 98. 1). Whether"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9011,"men will or not, they must be subject alwayes to the Divine Power. By"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9012,"denying the Existence, or Providence of God, men may shake off their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9013,"Ease, but not their Yoke. But to call this Power of God, which extendeth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9014,"it selfe not onely to Man, but also to Beasts, and Plants, and Bodies"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9015,"inanimate, by the name of Kingdome, is but a metaphoricall use of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9016,"the word. For he onely is properly said to Raigne, that governs his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9017,"Subjects, by his Word, and by promise of Rewards to those that obey"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9018,"it, and by threatning them with Punishment that obey it not. Subjects"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9019,"therefore in the Kingdome of God, are not Bodies Inanimate, nor"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9020,creatures Irrationall; because they understand no Precepts as his: Nor
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9021,Atheists; nor they that believe not that God has any care of the actions
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9022,"of mankind; because they acknowledge no Word for his, nor have hope of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9023,"his rewards, or fear of his threatnings. They therefore that believe"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9024,"there is a God that governeth the world, and hath given Praecepts, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9025,"propounded Rewards, and Punishments to Mankind, are Gods Subjects; all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9026,"the rest, are to be understood as Enemies."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9027,"A Threefold Word Of God, Reason, Revelation, Prophecy"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9028,"To rule by Words, requires that such Words be manifestly made known;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9029,for else they are no Lawes: For to the nature of Lawes belongeth a
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9030,"sufficient, and clear Promulgation, such as may take away the excuse of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9031,"Ignorance; which in the Lawes of men is but of one onely kind, and that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9032,"is, Proclamation, or Promulgation by the voyce of man. But God"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9033,"declareth his Lawes three wayes; by the Dictates of Naturall Reason, By"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9034,"Revelation, and by the Voyce of some Man, to whom by the operation of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9035,"Miracles, he procureth credit with the rest. From hence there ariseth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9036,"a triple Word of God, Rational, Sensible, and Prophetique: to which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9037,"Correspondeth a triple Hearing; Right Reason, Sense Supernaturall, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9038,"Faith. As for Sense Supernaturall, which consisteth in Revelation, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9039,"Inspiration, there have not been any Universall Lawes so given, because"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9040,"God speaketh not in that manner, but to particular persons, and to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9041,divers men divers things.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9042,"A Twofold Kingdome Of God, Naturall And Prophetique From the difference"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9043,"between the other two kinds of Gods Word, Rationall, and Prophetique,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9044,"there may be attributed to God, a two-fold Kingdome, Naturall, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9045,"Prophetique: Naturall, wherein he governeth as many of Mankind as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9046,"acknowledge his Providence, by the naturall Dictates of Right Reason;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9047,"And Prophetique, wherein having chosen out one peculiar Nation (the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9048,"Jewes) for his Subjects, he governed them, and none but them, not onely"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9049,"by naturall Reason, but by Positive Lawes, which he gave them by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9050,mouths of his holy Prophets. Of the Naturall Kingdome of God I intend to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9051,speak in this Chapter.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9052,The Right Of Gods Soveraignty Is Derived From His Omnipotence The Right
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9053,"of Nature, whereby God reigneth over men, and punisheth those that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9054,"break his Lawes, is to be derived, not from his Creating them, as if"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9055,"he required obedience, as of Gratitude for his benefits; but from his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9056,"Irresistible Power. I have formerly shewn, how the Soveraign Right"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9057,"ariseth from Pact: To shew how the same Right may arise from Nature,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9058,"requires no more, but to shew in what case it is never taken away."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9059,"Seeing all men by Nature had Right to All things, they had Right every"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9060,one to reigne over all the rest. But because this Right could not be
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9061,"obtained by force, it concerned the safety of every one, laying by that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9062,"Right, to set up men (with Soveraign Authority) by common consent,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9063,to rule and defend them: whereas if there had been any man of Power
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9064,"Irresistible; there had been no reason, why he should not by that Power"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9065,"have ruled, and defended both himselfe, and them, according to his own"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9066,"discretion. To those therefore whose Power is irresistible, the dominion"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9067,of all men adhaereth naturally by their excellence of Power; and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9068,"consequently it is from that Power, that the Kingdome over men, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9069,"the Right of afflicting men at his pleasure, belongeth Naturally to God"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9070,"Almighty; not as Creator, and Gracious; but as Omnipotent. And though"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9071,"Punishment be due for Sinne onely, because by that word is understood"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9072,"Affliction for Sinne; yet the Right of Afflicting, is not alwayes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9073,"derived from mens Sinne, but from Gods Power."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9074,Sinne Not The Cause Of All Affliction
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9075,"This question, ""Why Evill men often Prosper, and Good men suffer"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9076,"Adversity,"" has been much disputed by the Antient, and is the same"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9077,"with this of ours, ""By what Right God dispenseth the Prosperities and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9078,"Adversities of this life;"" and is of that difficulty, as it hath shaken"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9079,"the faith, not onely of the Vulgar, but of Philosophers, and which is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9080,"more, of the Saints, concerning the Divine Providence. ""How Good,"" saith"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9081,"David, ""is the God of Israel to those that are Upright in Heart; and yet"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9082,"my feet were almost gone, my treadings had well-nigh slipt; for I was"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9083,"grieved at the Wicked, when I saw the Ungodly in such Prosperity."""
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9084,"And Job, how earnestly does he expostulate with God, for the many"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9085,"Afflictions he suffered, notwithstanding his Righteousnesse? This"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9086,"question in the case of Job, is decided by God himselfe, not by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9087,"arguments derived from Job's Sinne, but his own Power. For whereas the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9088,"friends of Job drew their arguments from his Affliction to his Sinne,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9089,"and he defended himselfe by the conscience of his Innocence, God"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9090,"himselfe taketh up the matter, and having justified the Affliction by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9091,"arguments drawn from his Power, such as this ""Where was thou when I"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9092,"layd the foundations of the earth,"" and the like, both approved"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9093,"Job's Innocence, and reproved the Erroneous doctrine of his friends."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9094,"Conformable to this doctrine is the sentence of our Saviour, concerning"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9095,"the man that was born Blind, in these words, ""Neither hath this man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9096,"sinned, nor his fathers; but that the works of God might be made"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9097,"manifest in him."" And though it be said ""That Death entred into the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9098,"world by sinne,"" (by which is meant that if Adam had never sinned, he had"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9099,"never dyed, that is, never suffered any separation of his soule from his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9100,"body,) it follows not thence, that God could not justly have Afflicted"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9101,"him, though he had not Sinned, as well as he afflicteth other living"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9102,"creatures, that cannot sinne."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9103,Divine Lawes
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9104,"Having spoken of the Right of Gods Soveraignty, as grounded onely on"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9105,"Nature; we are to consider next, what are the Divine Lawes, or Dictates"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9106,of Naturall Reason; which Lawes concern either the naturall Duties of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9107,"one man to another, or the Honour naturally due to our Divine Soveraign."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9108,"The first are the same Lawes of Nature, of which I have spoken already"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9109,"in the 14. and 15. Chapters of this Treatise; namely, Equity, Justice,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9110,"Mercy, Humility, and the rest of the Morall Vertues. It remaineth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9111,"therefore that we consider, what Praecepts are dictated to men, by their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9112,"Naturall Reason onely, without other word of God, touching the Honour"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9113,and Worship of the Divine Majesty.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9114,Honour And Worship What
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9115,"Honour consisteth in the inward thought, and opinion of the Power, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9116,"Goodnesse of another: and therefore to Honour God, is to think as Highly"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9117,"of his Power and Goodnesse, as is possible. And of that opinion, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9118,"externall signes appearing in the Words, and Actions of men, are called"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9119,Worship; which is one part of that which the Latines understand by the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9120,"word Cultus: For Cultus signifieth properly, and constantly, that labour"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9121,"which a man bestowes on any thing, with a purpose to make benefit by it."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9122,"Now those things whereof we make benefit, are either subject to us, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9123,"the profit they yeeld, followeth the labour we bestow upon them, as a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9124,"naturall effect; or they are not subject to us, but answer our labour,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9125,according to their own Wills. In the first sense the labour bestowed on
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9126,"the Earth, is called Culture; and the education of Children a Culture of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9127,"their mindes. In the second sense, where mens wills are to be wrought to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9128,"our purpose, not by Force, but by Compleasance, it signifieth as much as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9129,"Courting, that is, a winning of favour by good offices; as by praises,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9130,"by acknowledging their Power, and by whatsoever is pleasing to them from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9131,whom we look for any benefit. And this is properly Worship: in which
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9132,"sense Publicola, is understood for a Worshipper of the People, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9133,"Cultus Dei, for the Worship of God."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9134,Severall Signes Of Honour
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9135,"From internall Honour, consisting in the opinion of Power and Goodnesse,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9136,"arise three Passions; Love, which hath reference to Goodnesse; and Hope,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9137,"and Fear, that relate to Power: And three parts of externall worship;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9138,"Praise, Magnifying, and Blessing: The subject of Praise, being"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9139,"Goodnesse; the subject of Magnifying, and Blessing, being Power, and the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9140,"effect thereof Felicity. Praise, and Magnifying are significant both by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9141,"Words, and Actions: By Words, when we say a man is Good, or Great:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9142,"By Actions, when we thank him for his Bounty, and obey his Power. The"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9143,"opinion of the Happinesse of another, can onely be expressed by words."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9144,Worship Naturall And Arbitrary
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9145,"There be some signes of Honour, (both in Attributes and Actions,) that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9146,"be Naturally so; as amongst Attributes, Good, Just, Liberall, and the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9147,"like; and amongst Actions, Prayers, Thanks, and Obedience. Others are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9148,"so by Institution, or Custome of men; and in some times and places are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9149,Honourable; in others Dishonourable; in others Indifferent: such as are
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9150,"the Gestures in Salutation, Prayer, and Thanksgiving, in different"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9151,"times and places, differently used. The former is Naturall; the later"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9152,Arbitrary Worship.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9153,Worship Commanded And Free
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9154,"And of Arbitrary Worship, there bee two differences: For sometimes it is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9155,"a Commanded, sometimes Voluntary Worship: Commanded, when it is such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9156,"as hee requireth, who is Worshipped: Free, when it is such as the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9157,"Worshipper thinks fit. When it is Commanded, not the words, or gestures,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9158,"but the obedience is the Worship. But when Free, the Worship consists"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9159,"in the opinion of the beholders: for if to them the words, or actions by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9160,"which we intend honour, seem ridiculous, and tending to contumely; they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9161,"are not Worship; because a signe is not a signe to him that giveth it,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9162,"but to him to whom it is made; that is, to the spectator."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9163,Worship Publique And Private
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9164,"Again, there is a Publique, and a Private Worship. Publique, is the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9165,"Worship that a Common-wealth performeth, as one Person. Private, is that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9166,"which a Private person exhibiteth. Publique, in respect of the whole"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9167,"Common-wealth, is Free; but in respect of Particular men it is not so."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9168,"Private, is in secret Free; but in the sight of the multitude, it is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9169,"never without some Restraint, either from the Lawes, or from the Opinion"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9170,of men; which is contrary to the nature of Liberty.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9171,The End Of Worship
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9172,"The End of Worship amongst men, is Power. For where a man seeth another"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9173,"worshipped he supposeth him powerfull, and is the readier to obey him;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9174,which makes his Power greater. But God has no Ends: the worship we do
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9175,"him, proceeds from our duty, and is directed according to our capacity,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9176,"by those rules of Honour, that Reason dictateth to be done by the weak"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9177,"to the more potent men, in hope of benefit, for fear of dammage, or in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9178,thankfulnesse for good already received from them.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9179,Attributes Of Divine Honour
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9180,That we may know what worship of God is taught us by the light of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9181,"Nature, I will begin with his Attributes. Where, First, it is manifest,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9182,we ought to attribute to him Existence: For no man can have the will to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9183,"honour that, which he thinks not to have any Beeing."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9184,"Secondly, that those Philosophers, who sayd the World, or the Soule of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9185,"the World was God, spake unworthily of him; and denyed his Existence:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9186,"For by God, is understood the cause of the World; and to say the World"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9187,"is God, is to say there is no cause of it, that is, no God."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9188,"Thirdly, to say the World was not Created, but Eternall, (seeing that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9189,"which is Eternall has no cause,) is to deny there is a God."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9190,"Fourthly, that they who attributing (as they think) Ease to God, take"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9191,from him the care of Mankind; take from him his Honour: for it takes
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9192,"away mens love, and fear of him; which is the root of Honour."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9193,"Fifthly, in those things that signifie Greatnesse, and Power; to say he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9194,"is Finite, is not to Honour him: For it is not a signe of the Will to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9195,"Honour God, to attribute to him lesse than we can; and Finite, is lesse"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9196,"than we can; because to Finite, it is easie to adde more."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9197,"Therefore to attribute Figure to him, is not Honour; for all Figure is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9198,Finite:
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9199,"Nor to say we conceive, and imagine, or have an Idea of him, in our"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9200,mind: for whatsoever we conceive is Finite:
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9201,"Not to attribute to him Parts, or Totality; which are the Attributes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9202,onely of things Finite:
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9203,"Nor to say he is this, or that Place: for whatsoever is in Place, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9204,"bounded, and Finite:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9205,"Nor that he is Moved, or Resteth: for both these Attributes ascribe to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9206,him Place:
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9207,Nor that there be more Gods than one; because it implies them all
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9208,Finite: for there cannot be more than one Infinite: Nor to ascribe to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9209,"him (unlesse Metaphorically, meaning not the Passion, but the Effect)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9210,"Passions that partake of Griefe; as Repentance, Anger, Mercy: or of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9211,"Want; as Appetite, Hope, Desire; or of any Passive faculty: For Passion,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9212,is Power limited by somewhat else.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9213,"And therefore when we ascribe to God a Will, it is not to be understood,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9214,"as that of Man, for a Rationall Appetite; but as the Power, by which he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9215,effecteth every thing.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9216,"Likewise when we attribute to him Sight, and other acts of Sense; as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9217,"also Knowledge, and Understanding; which in us is nothing else, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9218,"a tumult of the mind, raised by externall things that presse the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9219,organicall parts of mans body: For there is no such thing in God; and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9220,"being things that depend on naturall causes, cannot be attributed to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9221,him.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9222,"Hee that will attribute to God, nothing but what is warranted by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9223,"naturall Reason, must either use such Negative Attributes, as Infinite,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9224,"Eternall, Incomprehensible; or Superlatives, as Most High, Most Great,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9225,"and the like; or Indefinite, as Good, Just, Holy, Creator; and in such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9226,"sense, as if he meant not to declare what he is, (for that were to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9227,"circumscribe him within the limits of our Fancy,) but how much wee"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9228,"admire him, and how ready we would be to obey him; which is a signe of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9229,"Humility, and of a Will to honour him as much as we can: For there is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9230,"but one Name to signifie our Conception of his Nature, and that is, I"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9231,"AM: and but one Name of his Relation to us, and that is God; in which is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9232,"contained Father, King, and Lord."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9233,Actions That Are Signes Of Divine Honour
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9234,"Concerning the actions of Divine Worship, it is a most generall Precept"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9235,"of Reason, that they be signes of the Intention to Honour God; such as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9236,"are, First, Prayers: For not the Carvers, when they made Images, were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9237,thought to make them Gods; but the People that Prayed to them.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9238,"Secondly, Thanksgiving; which differeth from Prayer in Divine Worship,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9239,"no otherwise, than that Prayers precede, and Thanks succeed the benefit;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9240,"the end both of the one, and the other, being to acknowledge God, for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9241,"Author of all benefits, as well past, as future."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9242,"Thirdly, Gifts; that is to say, Sacrifices, and Oblations, (if they be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9243,"of the best,) are signes of Honour: for they are Thanksgivings."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9244,"Fourthly, Not to swear by any but God, is naturally a signe of Honour:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9245,for it is a confession that God onely knoweth the heart; and that no
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9246,"mans wit, or strength can protect a man against Gods vengence on the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9247,perjured.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9248,"Fifthly, it is a part of Rationall Worship, to speak Considerately"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9249,"of God; for it argues a Fear of him, and Fear, is a confession of his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9250,"Power. Hence followeth, That the name of God is not to be used rashly,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9251,"and to no purpose; for that is as much, as in Vain: And it is to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9252,"no purpose; unlesse it be by way of Oath, and by order of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9253,"Common-wealth, to make Judgements certain; or between Common-wealths,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9254,to avoyd Warre. And that disputing of Gods nature is contrary to his
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9255,"Honour: For it is supposed, that in this naturall Kingdome of God, there"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9256,"is no other way to know any thing, but by naturall Reason; that is, from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9257,the Principles of naturall Science; which are so farre from teaching us
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9258,"any thing of Gods nature, as they cannot teach us our own nature, nor"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9259,"the nature of the smallest creature living. And therefore, when men out"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9260,"of the Principles of naturall Reason, dispute of the Attributes of God,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9261,"they but dishonour him: For in the Attributes which we give to God, we"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9262,are not to consider the signification of Philosophicall Truth; but the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9263,"signification of Pious Intention, to do him the greatest Honour we are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9264,"able. From the want of which consideration, have proceeded the volumes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9265,"of disputation about the Nature of God, that tend not to his Honour, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9266,"to the honour of our own wits, and learning; and are nothing else but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9267,"inconsiderate, and vain abuses of his Sacred Name."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9268,"Sixthly, in Prayers, Thanksgivings, Offerings and Sacrifices, it is a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9269,"Dictate of naturall Reason, that they be every one in his kind the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9270,"best, and most significant of Honour. As for example, that Prayers, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9271,"Thanksgiving, be made in Words and Phrases, not sudden, nor light, nor"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9272,Plebeian; but beautifull and well composed; For else we do not God
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9273,"as much honour as we can. And therefore the Heathens did absurdly, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9274,"worship Images for Gods: But their doing it in Verse, and with Musick,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9275,"both of Voyce, and Instruments, was reasonable. Also that the Beasts"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9276,"they offered in sacrifice, and the Gifts they offered, and their actions"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9277,"in Worshipping, were full of submission, and commemorative of benefits"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9278,"received, was according to reason, as proceeding from an intention to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9279,honour him.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9280,"Seventhly, Reason directeth not onely to worship God in Secret; but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9281,"also, and especially, in Publique, and in the sight of men: For without"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9282,"that, (that which in honour is most acceptable) the procuring others to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9283,"honour him, is lost."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9284,"Lastly, Obedience to his Lawes (that is, in this case to the Lawes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9285,"of Nature,) is the greatest worship of all. For as Obedience is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9286,more acceptable to God than sacrifice; so also to set light by his
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9287,"Commandements, is the greatest of all contumelies. And these are the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9288,"Lawes of that Divine Worship, which naturall Reason dictateth to private"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9289,men.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9290,Publique Worship Consisteth In Uniformity
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9291,"But seeing a Common-wealth is but one Person, it ought also to exhibite"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9292,"to God but one Worship; which then it doth, when it commandeth it to be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9293,"exhibited by Private men, Publiquely. And this is Publique Worship; the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9294,"property whereof, is to be Uniforme: For those actions that are done"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9295,"differently, by different men, cannot be said to be a Publique Worship."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9296,"And therefore, where many sorts of Worship be allowed, proceeding from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9297,"the different Religions of Private men, it cannot be said there is any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9298,"Publique Worship, nor that the Common-wealth is of any Religion at all."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9299,All Attributes Depend On The Lawes Civill
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9300,And because words (and consequently the Attributes of God) have their
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9301,"signification by agreement, and constitution of men; those Attributes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9302,"are to be held significative of Honour, that men intend shall so be; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9303,"whatsoever may be done by the wills of particular men, where there is no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9304,"Law but Reason, may be done by the will of the Common-wealth, by Lawes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9305,"Civill. And because a Common-wealth hath no Will, nor makes no Lawes,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9306,"but those that are made by the Will of him, or them that have the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9307,"Soveraign Power; it followeth, that those Attributes which the Soveraign"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9308,"ordaineth, in the Worship of God, for signes of Honour, ought to be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9309,"taken and used for such, by private men in their publique Worship."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9310,Not All Actions
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9311,But because not all Actions are signes by Constitution; but some are
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9312,"Naturally signes of Honour, others of Contumely, these later (which are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9313,those that men are ashamed to do in the sight of them they reverence)
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9314,cannot be made by humane power a part of Divine worship; nor the former
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9315,"(such as are decent, modest, humble Behaviour) ever be separated from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9316,"it. But whereas there be an infinite number of Actions, and Gestures, of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9317,an indifferent nature; such of them as the Common-wealth shall ordain to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9318,"be Publiquely and Universally in use, as signes of Honour, and part of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9319,"Gods Worship, are to be taken and used for such by the Subjects. And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9320,"that which is said in the Scripture, ""It is better to obey God than"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9321,"men,"" hath place in the kingdome of God by Pact, and not by Nature."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9322,Naturall Punishments
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9323,"Having thus briefly spoken of the Naturall Kingdome of God, and his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9324,"Naturall Lawes, I will adde onely to this Chapter a short declaration of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9325,"his Naturall Punishments. There is no action of man in this life, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9326,"is not the beginning of so long a chayn of Consequences, as no humane"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9327,"Providence, is high enough, to give a man a prospect to the end. And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9328,"in this Chayn, there are linked together both pleasing and unpleasing"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9329,"events; in such manner, as he that will do any thing for his pleasure,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9330,must engage himselfe to suffer all the pains annexed to it; and these
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9331,"pains, are the Naturall Punishments of those actions, which are the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9332,"beginning of more Harme that Good. And hereby it comes to passe, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9333,"Intemperance, is naturally punished with Diseases; Rashnesse, with"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9334,"Mischances; Injustice, with the Violence of Enemies; Pride, with Ruine;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9335,"Cowardise, with Oppression; Negligent government of Princes, with"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9336,"Rebellion; and Rebellion, with Slaughter. For seeing Punishments"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9337,are consequent to the breach of Lawes; Naturall Punishments must be
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9338,naturally consequent to the breach of the Lawes of Nature; and therfore
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9339,"follow them as their naturall, not arbitrary effects."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9340,The Conclusion Of The Second Part
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9341,"And thus farre concerning the Constitution, Nature, and Right of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9342,"Soveraigns; and concerning the Duty of Subjects, derived from the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9343,"Principles of Naturall Reason. And now, considering how different"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9344,"this Doctrine is, from the Practise of the greatest part of the world,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9345,"especially of these Western parts, that have received their Morall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9346,"learning from Rome, and Athens; and how much depth of Morall Philosophy"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9347,"is required, in them that have the Administration of the Soveraign"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9348,"Power; I am at the point of believing this my labour, as uselesse,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9349,and the Common-wealth of Plato; For he also is of opinion that it is
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9350,"impossible for the disorders of State, and change of Governments by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9351,"Civill Warre, ever to be taken away, till Soveraigns be Philosophers."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9352,"But when I consider again, that the Science of Naturall Justice, is the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9353,"onely Science necessary for Soveraigns, and their principall Ministers;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9354,"and that they need not be charged with the Sciences Mathematicall, (as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9355,"by Plato they are,) further, than by good Lawes to encourage men to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9356,"the study of them; and that neither Plato, nor any other Philosopher"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9357,"hitherto, hath put into order, and sufficiently, or probably proved all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9358,"the Theoremes of Morall doctrine, that men may learn thereby, both how"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9359,"to govern, and how to obey; I recover some hope, that one time or other,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9360,"this writing of mine, may fall into the hands of a Soveraign, who will"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9361,"consider it himselfe, (for it is short, and I think clear,) without the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9362,"help of any interested, or envious Interpreter; and by the exercise of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9363,"entire Soveraignty, in protecting the Publique teaching of it, convert"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9364,"this Truth of Speculation, into the Utility of Practice."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,31,9365,PART III. OF A CHRISTIAN COMMON-WEALTH
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9366,CHAPTER XXXII. OF THE PRINCIPLES OF CHRISTIAN POLITIQUES
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9367,The Word Of God Delivered By Prophets Is The Main Principle
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9368,Of Christian Politiques
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9369,"I have derived the Rights of Soveraigne Power, and the duty of Subjects"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9370,"hitherto, from the Principles of Nature onely; such as Experience has"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9371,"found true, or Consent (concerning the use of words) has made so; that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9372,"is to say, from the nature of Men, known to us by Experience, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9373,from Definitions (of such words as are Essentiall to all Politicall
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9374,"reasoning) universally agreed on. But in that I am next to handle, which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9375,"is the Nature and Rights of a CHRISTIAN COMMON-WEALTH, whereof there"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9376,dependeth much upon Supernaturall Revelations of the Will of God; the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9377,"ground of my Discourse must be, not only the Naturall Word of God, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9378,also the Propheticall.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9379,"Neverthelesse, we are not to renounce our Senses, and Experience; nor"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9380,(that which is the undoubted Word of God) our naturall Reason. For they
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9381,"are the talents which he hath put into our hands to negotiate, till the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9382,coming again of our blessed Saviour; and therefore not to be folded up
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9383,"in the Napkin of an Implicate Faith, but employed in the purchase of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9384,"Justice, Peace, and true Religion, For though there be many things in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9385,"Gods Word above Reason; that is to say, which cannot by naturall reason"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9386,"be either demonstrated, or confuted; yet there is nothing contrary"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9387,"to it; but when it seemeth so, the fault is either in our unskilfull"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9388,"Interpretation, or erroneous Ratiocination."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9389,"Therefore, when any thing therein written is too hard for our"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9390,"examination, wee are bidden to captivate our understanding to the Words;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9391,"and not to labour in sifting out a Philosophicall truth by Logick, of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9392,"such mysteries as are not comprehensible, nor fall under any rule of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9393,"naturall science. For it is with the mysteries of our Religion, as with"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9394,"wholsome pills for the sick, which swallowed whole, have the vertue to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9395,"cure; but chewed, are for the most part cast up again without effect."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9396,What It Is To Captivate The Understanding
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9397,"But by the Captivity of our Understanding, is not meant a Submission of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9398,"the Intellectual faculty, to the Opinion of any other man; but of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9399,"the Will to Obedience, where obedience is due. For Sense, Memory,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9400,"Understanding, Reason, and Opinion are not in our power to change; but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9401,"alwaies, and necessarily such, as the things we see, hear, and consider"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9402,"suggest unto us; and therefore are not effects of our Will, but our Will"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9403,"of them. We then Captivate our Understanding and Reason, when we forbear"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9404,"contradiction; when we so speak, as (by lawfull Authority) we are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9405,"commanded; and when we live accordingly; which in sum, is Trust, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9406,"Faith reposed in him that speaketh, though the mind be incapable of any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9407,Notion at all from the words spoken.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9408,How God Speaketh To Men
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9409,"When God speaketh to man, it must be either immediately; or by mediation"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9410,"of another man, to whom he had formerly spoken by himself immediately."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9411,"How God speaketh to a man immediately, may be understood by those well"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9412,"enough, to whom he hath so spoken; but how the same should be understood"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9413,"by another, is hard, if not impossible to know. For if a man pretend to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9414,"me, that God hath spoken to him supernaturally, and immediately, and I"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9415,"make doubt of it, I cannot easily perceive what argument he can produce,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9416,"to oblige me to beleeve it. It is true, that if he be my Soveraign,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9417,"he may oblige me to obedience, so, as not by act or word to declare I"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9418,beleeve him not; but not to think any otherwise then my reason perswades
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9419,"me. But if one that hath not such authority over me, shall pretend the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9420,"same, there is nothing that exacteth either beleefe, or obedience."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9421,"For to say that God hath spoken to him in the Holy Scripture, is not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9422,"to say God hath spoken to him immediately, but by mediation of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9423,"Prophets, or of the Apostles, or of the Church, in such manner as he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9424,speaks to all other Christian men. To say he hath spoken to him in a
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9425,"Dream, is no more than to say he dreamed that God spake to him; which is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9426,"not of force to win beleef from any man, that knows dreams are for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9427,"the most part naturall, and may proceed from former thoughts; and such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9428,"dreams as that, from selfe conceit, and foolish arrogance, and false"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9429,"opinion of a mans own godlinesse, or other vertue, by which he thinks he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9430,hath merited the favour of extraordinary Revelation. To say he hath
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9431,"seen a Vision, or heard a Voice, is to say, that he hath dreamed between"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9432,sleeping and waking: for in such manner a man doth many times naturally
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9433,"take his dream for a vision, as not having well observed his own"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9434,"slumbering. To say he speaks by supernaturall Inspiration, is to say he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9435,"finds an ardent desire to speak, or some strong opinion of himself, for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9436,which he can alledge no naturall and sufficient reason. So that
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9437,"though God Almighty can speak to a man, by Dreams, Visions, Voice, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9438,Inspiration; yet he obliges no man to beleeve he hath so done to him
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9439,"that pretends it; who (being a man), may erre, and (which is more) may"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9440,lie.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9441,By What Marks Prophets Are Known
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9442,"How then can he, to whom God hath never revealed his Wil immediately"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9443,"(saving by the way of natural reason) know when he is to obey, or not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9444,"to obey his Word, delivered by him, that sayes he is a Prophet? (1 Kings"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9445,"22) Of 400 Prophets, of whom the K. of Israel asked counsel, concerning"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9446,"the warre he made against Ramoth Gilead, only Micaiah was a true one.(1"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9447,Kings 13) The Prophet that was sent to prophecy against the Altar set up
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9448,"by Jeroboam, though a true Prophet, and that by two miracles done in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9449,"his presence appears to be a Prophet sent from God, was yet deceived by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9450,"another old Prophet, that perswaded him as from the mouth of God, to eat"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9451,"and drink with him. If one Prophet deceive another, what certainty is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9452,"there of knowing the will of God, by other way than that of Reason? To"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9453,"which I answer out of the Holy Scripture, that there be two marks, by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9454,"which together, not asunder, a true Prophet is to be known. One is the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9455,doing of miracles; the other is the not teaching any other Religion than
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9456,that which is already established. Asunder (I say) neither of these is
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9457,"sufficient. (Deut. 13 v. 1,2,3,4,5 ) ""If a Prophet rise amongst you, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9458,"a Dreamer of dreams, and shall pretend the doing of a miracle, and the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9459,"miracle come to passe; if he say, Let us follow strange Gods, which thou"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9460,"hast not known, thou shalt not hearken to him, &c. But that Prophet and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9461,"Dreamer of dreams shall be put to death, because he hath spoken to you"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9462,"to Revolt from the Lord your God."" In which words two things are to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9463,"be observed, First, that God wil not have miracles alone serve for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9464,"arguments, to approve the Prophets calling; but (as it is in the third"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9465,verse) for an experiment of the constancy of our adherence to himself.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9466,"For the works of the Egyptian Sorcerers, though not so great as those"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9467,"of Moses, yet were great miracles. Secondly, that how great soever the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9468,"miracle be, yet if it tend to stir up revolt against the King, or him"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9469,"that governeth by the Kings authority, he that doth such miracle, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9470,not to be considered otherwise than as sent to make triall of their
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9471,"allegiance. For these words, ""revolt from the Lord your God,"" are in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9472,"this place equivalent to ""revolt from your King."" For they had made God"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9473,their King by pact at the foot of Mount Sinai; who ruled them by Moses
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9474,"only; for he only spake with God, and from time to time declared Gods"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9475,"Commandements to the people. In like manner, after our Saviour Christ"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9476,"had made his Disciples acknowledge him for the Messiah, (that is to say,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9477,"for Gods anointed, whom the nation of the Jews daily expected for their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9478,"King, but refused when he came,) he omitted not to advertise them of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9479,"danger of miracles. ""There shall arise,"" (saith he) ""false Christs, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9480,"false Prophets, and shall doe great wonders and miracles, even to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9481,"seducing (if it were possible) of the very Elect."" (Mat. 24. 24) By"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9482,"which it appears, that false Prophets may have the power of miracles;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9483,yet are wee not to take their doctrin for Gods Word. St. Paul says
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9484,"further to the Galatians, that ""if himself, or an Angell from heaven"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9485,"preach another Gospel to them, than he had preached, let him be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9486,"accursed."" (Gal. 1. 8) That Gospel was, that Christ was King; so that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9487,"all preaching against the power of the King received, in consequence"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9488,"to these words, is by St. Paul accursed. For his speech is addressed to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9489,"those, who by his preaching had already received Jesus for the Christ,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9490,"that is to say, for King of the Jews."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9491,"The Marks Of A Prophet In The Old Law, Miracles, And Doctrine"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9492,Conformable To The Law
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9493,"And as Miracles, without preaching that Doctrine which God hath"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9494,"established; so preaching the true Doctrine, without the doing of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9495,"Miracles, is an unsufficient argument of immediate Revelation. For if"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9496,"a man that teacheth not false Doctrine, should pretend to bee a Prophet"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9497,"without shewing any Miracle, he is never the more to bee regarded for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9498,"his pretence, as is evident by Deut. 18. v. 21, 22. ""If thou say in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9499,"thy heart, How shall we know that the Word (of the Prophet) is not that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9500,which the Lord hath spoken. When the Prophet shall have spoken in the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9501,"name of the Lord, that which shall not come to passe, that's the word"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9502,"which the Lord hath not spoken, but the Prophet has spoken it out of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9503,"the pride of his own heart, fear him not."" But a man may here again ask,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9504,"When the Prophet hath foretold a thing, how shal we know whether it will"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9505,come to passe or not? For he may foretel it as a thing to arrive after
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9506,"a certain long time, longer then the time of mans life; or indefinitely,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9507,that it will come to passe one time or other: in which case this mark
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9508,of a Prophet is unusefull; and therefore the miracles that oblige us to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9509,"beleeve a Prophet, ought to be confirmed by an immediate, or a not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9510,"long deferr'd event. So that it is manifest, that the teaching of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9511,"the Religion which God hath established, and the showing of a present"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9512,"Miracle, joined together, were the only marks whereby the Scripture"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9513,"would have a true Prophet, that is to say immediate Revelation to be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9514,acknowledged; neither of them being singly sufficient to oblige any
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9515,other man to regard what he saith.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9516,"Miracles Ceasing, Prophets Cease, The Scripture Supplies Their Place"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9517,"Seeing therefore Miracles now cease, we have no sign left, whereby to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9518,"acknowledge the pretended Revelations, or Inspirations of any private"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9519,"man; nor obligation to give ear to any Doctrine, farther than it is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9520,"conformable to the Holy Scriptures, which since the time of our Saviour,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9521,"supply the want of all other Prophecy; and from which, by wise and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9522,"careful ratiocination, all rules and precepts necessary to the knowledge"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9523,"of our duty both to God and man, without Enthusiasme, or supernaturall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9524,"Inspiration, may easily be deduced. And this Scripture is it, out of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9525,"which I am to take the Principles of my Discourse, concerning the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9526,"Rights of those that are the Supream Govenors on earth, of Christian"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9527,Common-wealths; and of the duty of Christian Subjects towards their
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9528,"Soveraigns. And to that end, I shall speak in the next Chapter, or the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,32,9529,"Books, Writers, Scope and Authority of the Bible."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9530,"CHAPTER XXXIII. OF THE NUMBER, ANTIQUITY, SCOPE, AUTHORITY,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9531,AND INTERPRETERS OF THE BOOKS OF HOLY SCRIPTURES
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9532,Of The Books Of Holy Scripture
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9533,"By the Books of Holy SCRIPTURE, are understood those, which ought to be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9534,"the Canon, that is to say, the Rules of Christian life. And because all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9535,"Rules of life, which men are in conscience bound to observe, are Laws;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9536,"the question of the Scripture, is the question of what is Law throughout"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9537,"all Christendome, both Naturall, and Civill. For though it be not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9538,"determined in Scripture, what Laws every Christian King shall constitute"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9539,in his own Dominions; yet it is determined what laws he shall not
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9540,"constitute. Seeing therefore I have already proved, that Soveraigns"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9541,in their own Dominions are the sole Legislators; those Books only are
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9542,"Canonicall, that is, Law, in every nation, which are established for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9543,"such by the Soveraign Authority. It is true, that God is the Soveraign"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9544,"of all Soveraigns; and therefore, when he speaks to any Subject, he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9545,"ought to be obeyed, whatsoever any earthly Potentate command to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9546,"contrary. But the question is not of obedience to God, but of When,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9547,and What God hath said; which to Subjects that have no supernaturall
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9548,"revelation, cannot be known, but by that naturall reason, which guided"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9549,"them, for the obtaining of Peace and Justice, to obey the authority"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9550,"of their severall Common-wealths; that is to say, of their lawfull"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9551,"Soveraigns. According to this obligation, I can acknowledge no other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9552,"Books of the Old Testament, to be Holy Scripture, but those which have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9553,"been commanded to be acknowledged for such, by the Authority of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9554,"Church of England. What Books these are, is sufficiently known, without"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9555,a Catalogue of them here; and they are the same that are acknowledged
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9556,"by St. Jerome, who holdeth the rest, namely, the Wisdome of Solomon,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9557,"Ecclesiasticus, Judith, Tobias, the first and second of Maccabees,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9558,(though he had seen the first in Hebrew) and the third and fourth of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9559,"Esdras, for Apocrypha. Of the Canonicall, Josephus a learned Jew, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9560,"wrote in the time of the Emperor Domitian, reckoneth Twenty Two, making"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9561,"the number agree with the Hebrew Alphabet. St. Jerome does the same,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9562,though they reckon them in different manner. For Josephus numbers Five
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9563,"Books of Moses, Thirteen of Prophets, that writ the History of their own"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9564,times (which how it agrees with the Prophets writings contained in the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9565,"Bible wee shall see hereafter), and Four of Hymnes and Morall Precepts."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9566,"But St. Jerome reckons Five Books of Moses, Eight of Prophets, and Nine"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9567,"of other Holy writ, which he calls of Hagiographa. The Septuagint, who"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9568,"were 70. learned men of the Jews, sent for by Ptolemy King of Egypt, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9569,"translate the Jewish Law, out of the Hebrew into the Greek, have left us"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9570,"no other for holy Scripture in the Greek tongue, but the same that are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9571,received in the Church of England.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9572,"As for the Books of the New Testament, they are equally acknowledged for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9573,"Canon by all Christian Churches, and by all sects of Christians, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9574,admit any Books at all for Canonicall.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9575,Their Antiquity
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9576,"Who were the originall writers of the severall Books of Holy Scripture,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9577,"has not been made evident by any sufficient testimony of other History,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9578,(which is the only proof of matter of fact); nor can be by any arguments
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9579,of naturall Reason; for Reason serves only to convince the truth (not
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9580,"of fact, but) of consequence. The light therefore that must guide us in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9581,"this question, must be that which is held out unto us from the Bookes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9582,"themselves: And this light, though it show us not the writer of every"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9583,"book, yet it is not unusefull to give us knowledge of the time, wherein"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9584,they were written.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9585,The Pentateuch Not Written By Moses
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9586,"And first, for the Pentateuch, it is not argument enough that they were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9587,"written by Moses, because they are called the five Books of Moses; no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9588,"more than these titles, The Book of Joshua, the Book of Judges, The Book"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9589,"of Ruth, and the Books of the Kings, are arguments sufficient to prove,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9590,"that they were written by Joshua, by the Judges, by Ruth, and by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9591,"Kings. For in titles of Books, the subject is marked, as often as the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9592,"writer. The History Of Livy, denotes the Writer; but the History Of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9593,"Scanderbeg, is denominated from the subject. We read in the last Chapter"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9594,"of Deuteronomie, Ver. 6. concerning the sepulcher of Moses, ""that no man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9595,"knoweth of his sepulcher to this day,"" that is, to the day wherein those"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9596,"words were written. It is therefore manifest, that those words were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9597,"written after his interrement. For it were a strange interpretation, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9598,"say Moses spake of his own sepulcher (though by Prophecy), that it was"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9599,"not found to that day, wherein he was yet living. But it may perhaps"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9600,"be alledged, that the last Chapter only, not the whole Pentateuch, was"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9601,"written by some other man, but the rest not: Let us therefore consider"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9602,"that which we find in the Book of Genesis, Chap. 12. Ver. 6 ""And Abraham"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9603,"passed through the land to the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9604,"and the Canaanite was then in the land;"" which must needs bee the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9605,words of one that wrote when the Canaanite was not in the land; and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9606,"consequently, not of Moses, who dyed before he came into it. Likewise"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9607,"Numbers 21. Ver. 14. the Writer citeth another more ancient Book,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9608,"Entituled, The Book of the Warres of the Lord, wherein were registred"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9609,"the Acts of Moses, at the Red-sea, and at the brook of Arnon. It is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9610,"therefore sufficiently evident, that the five Books of Moses were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9611,"written after his time, though how long after it be not so manifest."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9612,"But though Moses did not compile those Books entirely, and in the form"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9613,we have them; yet he wrote all that which hee is there said to have
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9614,"written: as for example, the Volume of the Law, which is contained, as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9615,"it seemeth in the 11 of Deuteronomie, and the following Chapters to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9616,"27. which was also commanded to be written on stones, in their entry"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9617,into the land of Canaan. (Deut. 31. 9) And this did Moses himself
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9618,"write, and deliver to the Priests and Elders of Israel, to be read"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9619,"every seventh year to all Israel, at their assembling in the feast of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9620,"Tabernacles. And this is that Law which God commanded, that their Kings"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9627,The Book of Joshua Written After His Time
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9628,"That the Book of Joshua was also written long after the time of Joshua,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9629,may be gathered out of many places of the Book it self. Joshua had
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9630,"set up twelve stones in the middest of Jordan, for a monument of their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9631,"passage; (Josh 4. 9) of which the Writer saith thus, ""They are there"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9632,"unto this day;"" (Josh 5. 9) for ""unto this day"", is a phrase that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9633,"signifieth a time past, beyond the memory of man. In like manner, upon"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9634,"the saying of the Lord, that he had rolled off from the people the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9635,"Reproach of Egypt, the Writer saith, ""The place is called Gilgal unto"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9636,"this day;"" which to have said in the time of Joshua had been improper."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9637,"So also the name of the Valley of Achor, from the trouble that Achan"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9638,"raised in the Camp, (Josh. 7. 26) the Writer saith, ""remaineth unto"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9639,"this day;"" which must needs bee therefore long after the time of Joshua."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9640,Arguments of this kind there be many other; as Josh. 8. 29. 13. 13. 14.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9641,14. 15. 63.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9642,The Booke Of Judges And Ruth Written Long After The Captivity
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9643,"The same is manifest by like arguments of the Book of Judges, chap. 1."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9644,"21,26 6.24 10.4 15.19 17.6 and Ruth 1. 1. but especially Judg. 18. 30."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9645,"where it is said, that Jonathan ""and his sonnes were Priests to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9646,"Tribe of Dan, untill the day of the captivity of the land."""
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9647,The Like Of The Bookes Of Samuel
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9648,"That the Books of Samuel were also written after his own time, there"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9649,"are the like arguments, 1 Sam. 5.5. 7.13,15. 27.6. & 30.25. where, after"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9650,"David had adjudged equall part of the spoiles, to them that guarded"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9651,"the Ammunition, with them that fought, the Writer saith, ""He made it a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9652,"Statute and an Ordinance to Israel to this day."" (2. Sam. 6.4.) Again,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9653,"when David (displeased, that the Lord had slain Uzzah, for putting out"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9654,"his hand to sustain the Ark,) called the place Perez-Uzzah, the Writer"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9655,"saith, it is called so ""to this day"": the time therefore of the writing"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9656,"of that Book, must be long after the time of the fact; that is, long"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9657,after the time of David.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9658,"The Books Of The Kings, And The Chronicles"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9659,"As for the two Books of the Kings, and the two books of the Chronicles,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9660,"besides the places which mention such monuments, as the Writer saith,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9661,remained till his own days; such as are 1 Kings 9.13. 9.21. 10. 12.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9662,12.19. 2 Kings 2.22. 8.22. 10.27. 14.7. 16.6. 17.23. 17.34. 17.41. 1
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9663,Chron. 4.41. 5.26. It is argument sufficient they were written after the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9664,"captivity in Babylon, that the History of them is continued till that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9665,time. For the Facts Registred are alwaies more ancient than such Books
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9666,"as make mention of, and quote the Register; as these Books doe in divers"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9667,"places, referring the Reader to the Chronicles of the Kings of Juda,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9668,"to the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel, to the Books of the Prophet"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9669,"Samuel, or the Prophet Nathan, of the Prophet Ahijah; to the Vision of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9670,"Jehdo, to the Books of the Prophet Serveiah, and of the Prophet Addo."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9671,Ezra And Nehemiah
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9672,The Books of Esdras and Nehemiah were written certainly after their
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9673,"return from captivity; because their return, the re-edification of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9674,"the walls and houses of Jerusalem, the renovation of the Covenant, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9675,ordination of their policy are therein contained.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9676,Esther
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9677,The History of Queen Esther is of the time of the Captivity; and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9678,"therefore the Writer must have been of the same time, or after it."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9679,Job
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9680,The Book of Job hath no mark in it of the time wherein it was written:
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9681,"and though it appear sufficiently (Exekiel 14.14, and James 5.11.)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9682,that he was no fained person; yet the Book it self seemeth not to be
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9683,"a History, but a Treatise concerning a question in ancient time much"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9684,"disputed, ""why wicked men have often prospered in this world, and good"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9685,"men have been afflicted;"" and it is the most probably, because from the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9686,"beginning, to the third verse of the third chapter, where the complaint"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9687,"of Job beginneth, the Hebrew is (as St. Jerome testifies) in prose; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9688,from thence to the sixt verse of the last chapter in Hexameter Verses;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9689,and the rest of that chapter again in prose. So that the dispute is all
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9690,"in verse; and the prose is added, but as a Preface in the beginning, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9691,"an Epilogue in the end. But Verse is no usuall stile of such, as either"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9692,"are themselves in great pain, as Job; or of such as come to comfort"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9693,"them, as his friends; but in Philosophy, especially morall Philosophy,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9694,in ancient time frequent.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9695,The Psalter
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9696,"The Psalmes were written the most part by David, for the use of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9697,"Quire. To these are added some songs of Moses, and other holy men; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9698,some of them after the return from the Captivity; as the 137. and the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9699,"126. whereby it is manifest that the Psalter was compiled, and put into"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9700,"the form it now hath, after the return of the Jews from Babylon."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9701,The Proverbs
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9702,"The Proverbs, being a Collection of wise and godly Sayings, partly of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9703,"Solomon, partly of Agur the son of Jakeh; and partly of the Mother"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9704,"of King Lemuel, cannot probably be thought to have been collected by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9705,"Solomon, rather then by Agur, or the Mother of Lemues; and that, though"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9706,"the sentences be theirs, yet the collection or compiling them into this"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9707,"one Book, was the work of some other godly man, that lived after them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9708,all.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9709,Ecclesiastes And The Canticles
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9710,The Books of Ecclesiastes and the Canticles have nothing that was not
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9711,"Solomons, except it be the Titles, or Inscriptions. For ""The Words of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9712,"the Preacher, the Son of David, King in Jerusalem;"" and, ""the Song of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9713,"Songs, which is Solomon's,"" seem to have been made for distinctions"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9714,"sake, then, when the Books of Scripture were gathered into one body of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9715,"the Law; to the end, that not the Doctrine only, but the Authors also"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9716,might be extant.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9717,The Prophets
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9718,"Of the Prophets, the most ancient, are Sophoniah, Jonas, Amos, Hosea,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9719,"Isaiah and Michaiah, who lived in the time of Amaziah, and Azariah,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9720,"otherwise Ozias, Kings of Judah. But the Book of Jonas is not properly"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9721,"a Register of his Prophecy, (for that is contained in these few words,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9722,"""Fourty dayes and Ninivy shall be destroyed,"") but a History or Narration"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9723,of his frowardenesse and disputing Gods commandements; so that there is
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9724,"small probability he should be the Author, seeing he is the subject of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9725,it. But the Book of Amos is his Prophecy.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9726,"Jeremiah, Abdias, Nahum, and Habakkuk prophecyed in the time of Josiah."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9727,"Ezekiel, Daniel, Aggeus, and Zacharias, in the Captivity."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9728,"When Joel and Malachi prophecyed, is not evident by their Writings. But"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9729,"considering the Inscriptions, or Titles of their Books, it is manifest"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9730,"enough, that the whole Scripture of the Old Testament, was set forth in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9731,"the form we have it, after the return of the Jews from their Captivity"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9732,"in Babylon, and before the time of Ptolemaeus Philadelphus, that caused"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9733,"it to bee translated into Greek by seventy men, which were sent him"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9734,out of Judea for that purpose. And if the Books of Apocrypha (which
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9735,"are recommended to us by the Church, though not for Canonicall, yet for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9736,"profitable Books for our instruction) may in this point be credited, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9737,"Scripture was set forth in the form wee have it in, by Esdras; as may"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9738,"appear by that which he himself saith, in the second book, chapt. 14."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9739,"verse 21, 22, &c. where speaking to God, he saith thus, ""Thy law is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9740,"burnt; therefore no man knoweth the things which thou has done, or the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9741,"works that are to begin. But if I have found Grace before thee, send"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9742,"down the holy Spirit into me, and I shall write all that hath been done"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9743,"in the world, since the beginning, which were written in thy Law, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9744,"men may find thy path, and that they which will live in the later days,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9745,"may live."" And verse 45. ""And it came to passe when the forty dayes were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9746,"fulfilled, that the Highest spake, saying, 'The first that thou hast"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9747,"written, publish openly, that the worthy and unworthy may read it; but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9748,"keep the seventy last, that thou mayst deliver them onely to such as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9749,"be wise among the people.'"" And thus much concerning the time of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9750,writing of the Bookes of the Old Testament.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9751,The New Testament
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9752,The Writers of the New Testament lived all in lesse then an age after
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9753,"Christs Ascension, and had all of them seen our Saviour, or been his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9754,"Disciples, except St. Paul, and St. Luke; and consequently whatsoever"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9755,"was written by them, is as ancient as the time of the Apostles. But"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9756,"the time wherein the Books of the New Testament were received, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9757,"acknowledged by the Church to be of their writing, is not altogether so"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9758,"ancient. For, as the Bookes of the Old Testament are derived to us, from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9759,"no higher time then that of Esdras, who by the direction of Gods Spirit"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9760,"retrived them, when they were lost: Those of the New Testament, of which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9761,"the copies were not many, nor could easily be all in any one private"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9762,"mans hand, cannot bee derived from a higher time, that that wherein the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9763,"Governours of the Church collected, approved, and recommended them to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9764,"us, as the writings of those Apostles and Disciples; under whose names"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9765,"they go. The first enumeration of all the Bookes, both of the Old,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9766,"and New Testament, is in the Canons of the Apostles, supposed to be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9767,collected by Clement the first (after St. Peter) Bishop of Rome. But
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9768,"because that is but supposed, and by many questioned, the Councell of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9769,"Laodicea is the first we know, that recommended the Bible to the then"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9770,"Christian Churches, for the Writings of the Prophets and Apostles: and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9771,"this Councell was held in the 364. yeer after Christ. At which time,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9772,"though ambition had so far prevailed on the great Doctors of the Church,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9773,"as no more to esteem Emperours, though Christian, for the Shepherds of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9774,"the people, but for Sheep; and Emperours not Christian, for Wolves; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9775,"endeavoured to passe their Doctrine, not for Counsell, and Information,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9776,"as Preachers; but for Laws, as absolute Governours; and thought such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9777,frauds as tended to make the people the more obedient to Christian
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9778,"Doctrine, to be pious; yet I am perswaded they did not therefore"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9779,"falsifie the Scriptures, though the copies of the Books of the New"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9780,"Testament, were in the hands only of the Ecclesiasticks; because if they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9781,"had had an intention so to doe, they would surely have made them more"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9782,"favorable to their power over Christian Princes, and Civill Soveraignty,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9783,"than they are. I see not therefore any reason to doubt, but that the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9784,"Old, and New Testament, as we have them now, are the true Registers of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9785,"those things, which were done and said by the Prophets, and Apostles."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9786,"And so perhaps are some of those Books which are called Apocrypha, if"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9787,"left out of the Canon, not for inconformity of Doctrine with the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9788,"rest, but only because they are not found in the Hebrew. For after the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9789,"conquest of Asia by Alexander the Great, there were few learned Jews,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9790,that were not perfect in the Greek tongue. For the seventy Interpreters
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9791,"that converted the Bible into Greek, were all of them Hebrews; and we"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9792,"have extant the works of Philo and Josephus both Jews, written by them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9793,"eloquently in Greek. But it is not the Writer, but the authority of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9794,"Church, that maketh a Book Canonicall."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9795,Their Scope
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9796,"And although these Books were written by divers men, yet it is manifest"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9797,"the Writers were all indued with one and the same Spirit, in that they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9798,"conspire to one and the same end, which is the setting forth of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9799,"Rights of the Kingdome of God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9800,"the Book of Genesis, deriveth the Genealogy of Gods people, from the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9801,"creation of the World, to the going into Egypt: the other four Books of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9802,"Moses, contain the Election of God for their King, and the Laws which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9803,"hee prescribed for their Government: The Books of Joshua, Judges, Ruth,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9804,"and Samuel, to the time of Saul, describe the acts of Gods people,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9805,"till the time they cast off Gods yoke, and called for a King, after the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9806,manner of their neighbour nations; The rest of the History of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9807,"Old Testament, derives the succession of the line of David, to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9808,"Captivity, out of which line was to spring the restorer of the Kingdome"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9809,"of God, even our blessed Saviour God the Son, whose coming was foretold"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9810,"in the Bookes of the Prophets, after whom the Evangelists writt his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9811,"life, and actions, and his claim to the Kingdome, whilst he lived one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9812,"earth: and lastly, the Acts, and Epistles of the Apostles, declare the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9813,"coming of God, the Holy Ghost, and the Authority he left with them, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9814,"their successors, for the direction of the Jews, and for the invitation"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9815,"of the Gentiles. In summe, the Histories and the Prophecies of the old"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9816,"Testament, and the Gospels, and Epistles of the New Testament, have had"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9817,"one and the same scope, to convert men to the obedience of God; 1. in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9818,"Moses, and the Priests; 2. in the man Christ; and 3. in the Apostles and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9819,the successors to Apostolicall power. For these three at several times
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9820,"did represent the person of God: Moses, and his successors the High"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9821,"Priests, and Kings of Judah, in the Old Testament: Christ himself, in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9822,"the time he lived on earth: and the Apostles, and their successors, from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9823,the day of Pentecost (when the Holy Ghost descended on them) to this
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9824,day.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9825,The Question Of The Authority Of The Scriptures Stated.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9826,It is a question much disputed between the divers sects of Christian
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9827,"Religion, From Whence The Scriptures Derive Their Authority; which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9828,"question is also propounded sometimes in other terms, as, How Wee Know"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9829,"Them To Be The Word Of God, or, Why We Beleeve Them To Be So: and the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9830,"difficulty of resolving it, ariseth chiefly from the impropernesse of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9831,the words wherein the question it self is couched. For it is beleeved
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9832,"on all hands, that the first and originall Author of them is God; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9833,"consequently the question disputed, is not that. Again, it is manifest,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9834,"that none can know they are Gods Word, (though all true Christians"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9835,"beleeve it,) but those to whom God himself hath revealed it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9836,"supernaturally; and therefore the question is not rightly moved, of our"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9838,"because some are moved to beleeve for one, and others for other reasons,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9839,there can be rendred no one generall answer for them all. The question
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9840,"truly stated is, By What Authority They Are Made Law."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9841,Their Authority And Interpretation
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9842,"As far as they differ not from the Laws of Nature, there is no doubt,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9843,"but they are the Law of God, and carry their Authority with them,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9844,legible to all men that have the use of naturall reason: but this is
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9845,"no other Authority, then that of all other Morall Doctrine consonant to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9846,"Reason; the Dictates whereof are Laws, not Made, but Eternall."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9847,"If they be made Law by God himselfe, they are of the nature of written"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9848,"Law, which are Laws to them only to whom God hath so sufficiently"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9849,"published them, as no man can excuse himself, by saying, he know not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9850,they were his.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9851,"He therefore, to whom God hath not supernaturally revealed, that they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9852,"are his, nor that those that published them, were sent by him, is not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9853,"obliged to obey them, by any Authority, but his, whose Commands have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9854,"already the force of Laws; that is to say, by any other Authority, then"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9855,"that of the Common-wealth, residing in the Soveraign, who only has the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9856,"Legislative power. Again, if it be not the Legislative Authority of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9857,"the Common-wealth, that giveth them the force of Laws, it must bee"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9858,"some other Authority derived from God, either private, or publique:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9859,"if private, it obliges onely him, to whom in particular God hath been"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9860,"pleased to reveale it. For if every man should be obliged, to take for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9861,"Gods Law, what particular men, on pretence of private Inspiration, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9862,"Revelation, should obtrude upon him, (in such a number of men, that out"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9863,"of pride, and ignorance, take their own Dreams, and extravagant Fancies,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9864,"and Madnesse, for testimonies of Gods Spirit; or out of ambition,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9865,"pretend to such Divine testimonies, falsely, and contrary to their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9866,"own consciences,) it were impossible that any Divine Law should be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9867,"acknowledged. If publique, it is the Authority of the Common-wealth, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9868,"of the Church. But the Church, if it be one person, is the same thing"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9869,"with a Common-wealth of Christians; called a Common-wealth, because it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9870,"consisteth of men united in one person, their Soveraign; and a Church,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9871,"because it consisteth in Christian men, united in one Christian"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9872,"Soveraign. But if the Church be not one person, then it hath no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9873,"authority at all; it can neither command, nor doe any action at all; nor"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9874,"is capable of having any power, or right to any thing; nor has any Will,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9875,"Reason, nor Voice; for all these qualities are personall. Now if the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9876,"whole number of Christians be not contained in one Common-wealth, they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9877,are not one person; nor is there an Universall Church that hath any
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9878,"authority over them; and therefore the Scriptures are not made Laws,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9879,"by the Universall Church: or if it bee one Common-wealth, then all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9880,"Christian Monarchs, and States are private persons, and subject to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9881,"bee judged, deposed, and punished by an Universall Soveraigne of all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9882,Christendome. So that the question of the Authority of the Scriptures is
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9883,"reduced to this, ""Whether Christian Kings, and the Soveraigne Assemblies"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,33,9884,"in Christian Common-wealths, be absolute in their own Territories,"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9904,"begin with the words BODY, and SPIRIT, which in the language of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9905,"Schools are termed, Substances, Corporeall, and Incorporeall."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9906,"The Word Body, in the most generall acceptation, signifieth that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9907,"which filleth, or occupyeth some certain room, or imagined place; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9908,"dependeth not on the imagination, but is a reall part of that we call"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9909,"the Universe. For the Universe, being the Aggregate of all Bodies, there"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9910,is no reall part thereof that is not also Body; nor any thing properly
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9911,"a Body, that is not also part of (that Aggregate of all Bodies) the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9912,"Universe. The same also, because Bodies are subject to change, that is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9913,"to say, to variety of apparence to the sense of living creatures, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9914,"called Substance, that is to say, Subject, to various accidents, as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9915,"sometimes to be Moved, sometimes to stand Still; and to seem to our"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9916,"senses sometimes Hot, sometimes Cold, sometimes of one Colour, Smel,"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9918,"(produced by the diversity of the operation of bodies, on the organs"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9919,"of our sense) we attribute to alterations of the Bodies that operate, &"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9920,call them Accidents of those Bodies. And according to this acceptation
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9921,"of the word, Substance and Body, signifie the same thing; and therefore"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9922,"Substance Incorporeall are words, which when they are joined together,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9923,"destroy one another, as if a man should say, an Incorporeall Body."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9924,"But in the sense of common people, not all the Universe is called Body,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9925,"but only such parts thereof as they can discern by the sense of Feeling,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9926,"to resist their force, or by the sense of their Eyes, to hinder them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9927,"from a farther prospect. Therefore in the common language of men, Aire,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9928,"and Aeriall Substances, use not to be taken for Bodies, but (as often"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9929,"as men are sensible of their effects) are called Wind, or Breath, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9930,(because the some are called in the Latine Spiritus) Spirits; as when

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9939,"And men, that are otherwise imployed, then to search into their causes,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9940,"know not of themselves, what to call them; and may therefore easily be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9941,"perswaded, by those whose knowledge they much reverence, some to"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9945,"place where they appear, to resist their fingers: So that the proper"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9946,"signification of Spirit in common speech, is either a subtile, fluid,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9947,"and invisible Body, or a Ghost, or other Idol or Phantasme of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9948,"Imagination. But for metaphoricall significations, there be many: for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9949,sometimes it is taken for Disposition or Inclination of the mind; as
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9950,"when for the disposition to controwl the sayings of other men, we say,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9951,"A Spirit Contradiction; For A Disposition to Uncleannesse, An Unclean"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9954,"of God: sometimes for any eminent ability, or extraordinary passion,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9955,"or disease of the mind, as when Great Wisdome is called the Spirit Of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9956,Wisdome; and Mad Men are said to be Possessed With A Spirit.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9957,Other signification of Spirit I find no where any; and where none

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,9961,"is said to be a Spirit; or where by the Spirit of God, is meant God"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10053,"(that is, as it is exprest, Mat. 4.1. and Mar. 1.12. ""of the Holy"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10055,"sent by God the Father: but to interpret it of a Ghost, is to say, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10056,"God himselfe (for so our Saviour was,) was filled with God; which is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10057,"very unproper, and unsignificant. How we came to translate Spirits, by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10058,"the word Ghosts, which signifieth nothing, neither in heaven, nor earth,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10059,"but the Imaginary inhabitants of mans brain, I examine not: but this I"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10060,"say, the word Spirit in the text signifieth no such thing; but either"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10061,"properly a reall Substance, or Metaphorically, some extraordinary"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10062,"Ability of Affection of the Mind, or of the Body."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10063,"Seventhly, For Aeriall Bodies"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10064,"The Disciples of Christ, seeing him walking upon the sea, (Mat. 14.26."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10065,"and Marke 6.49.) supposed him to be a Spirit, meaning thereby an Aeriall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10066,"Body, and not a Phantasme: for it is said, they all saw him; which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10067,"cannot be understood of the delusions of the brain, (which are not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10068,"common to many at once, as visible Bodies are; but singular, because of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10069,"the differences of Fancies), but of Bodies only. In like manner, where"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10070,"he was taken for a Spirit, by the same Apostles (Luke 24.3,7.): So also"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10071,"(Acts 12.15) when St. Peter was delivered out of Prison, it would not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10072,"be beleeved; but when the Maid said he was at the dore, they said it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10073,"was his Angel; by which must be meant a corporeall substance, or we must"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10074,"say, the Disciples themselves did follow the common opinion of both Jews"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10075,"and Gentiles, that some such apparitions were not Imaginary, but Reall;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10076,and such as needed not the fancy of man for their Existence: These the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10077,"Jews called Spirits, and Angels, Good or Bad; as the Greeks called the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10078,"same by the name of Daemons. And some such apparitions may be reall, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10079,"substantiall; that is to say, subtile Bodies, which God can form by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10080,"the same power, by which he formed all things, and make use of, as of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10081,"Ministers, and Messengers (that is to say, Angels) to declare his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10082,"will, and execute the same when he pleaseth, in extraordinary and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10083,supernaturall manner. But when hee hath so formed them they are
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10084,"Substances, endued with dimensions, and take up roome, and can be moved"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10085,"from place to place, which is peculiar to Bodies; and therefore are not"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10089,"manner, for such Substances as are perceptible by our externall Senses;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10090,"then is Substance Incorporeall, a thing not Imaginary, but Reall;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10091,"namely, a thin Substance Invisible, but that hath the same dimensions"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10092,that are in grosser Bodies.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10093,Angel What
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10094,"By the name of ANGEL, is signified generally, a Messenger; and most"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10095,"often, a Messenger of God: And by a Messenger of God, is signified, any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10096,"thing that makes known his extraordinary Presence; that is to say, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10097,"extraordinary manifestation of his power, especially by a Dream, or"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10099,"Concerning the creation of Angels, there is nothing delivered in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10100,"Scriptures. That they are Spirits, is often repeated: but by the name of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10101,"Spirit, is signified both in Scripture, and vulgarly, both amongst Jews,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10102,"and Gentiles, sometimes thin Bodies; as the Aire, the Wind, the Spirits"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10103,"Vitall, and Animall, of living creatures; and sometimes the Images"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10104,"that rise in the fancy in Dreams, and Visions; which are not reall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10105,"Substances, but accidents of the brain; yet when God raiseth them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10106,"supernaturally, to signifie his Will, they are not unproperly termed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10107,"Gods Messengers, that is to say, his Angels."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10108,"And as the Gentiles did vulgarly conceive the Imagery of the brain, for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10109,"things really subsistent without them, and not dependent on the fancy;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10110,"and out of them framed their opinions of Daemons, Good and Evill; which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10111,"because they seemed to subsist really, they called Substances; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10112,"because they could not feel them with their hands, Incorporeall: so also"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10113,"the Jews upon the same ground, without any thing in the Old Testament"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10114,"that constrained them thereunto, had generally an opinion, (except the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10115,"sect of the Sadduces,) that those apparitions (which it pleased God"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10116,"sometimes to produce in the fancie of men, for his own service, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10117,"therefore called them his Angels) were substances, not dependent on the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10118,"fancy, but permanent creatures of God; whereof those which they thought"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10119,"were good to them, they esteemed the Angels of God, and those they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10120,"thought would hurt them, they called Evill Angels, or Evill Spirits;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10121,"such as was the Spirit of Python, and the Spirits of Mad-men, of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10122,"Lunatiques, and Epileptiques: For they esteemed such as were troubled"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10123,"with such diseases, Daemoniaques."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10124,But if we consider the places of the Old Testament where Angels are
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10125,"mentioned, we shall find, that in most of them, there can nothing else"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10126,"be understood by the word Angel, but some image raised (supernaturally)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10127,"in the fancy, to signifie the presence of God in the execution of some"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10128,"supernaturall work; and therefore in the rest, where their nature is not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10129,"exprest, it may be understood in the same manner."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10130,"For we read Gen. 16. that the same apparition is called, not onely an"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10131,"Angel, but God; where that which (verse 7.) is called the Angel of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10132,"the Lord, in the tenth verse, saith to Agar, ""I will multiply thy seed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10133,"exceedingly;"" that is, speaketh in the person of God. Neither was this"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10134,"apparition a Fancy figured, but a Voice. By which it is manifest,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10135,"that Angel signifieth there, nothing but God himself, that caused Agar"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10136,"supernaturally to apprehend a voice supernaturall, testifying Gods"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10137,speciall presence there. Why therefore may not the Angels that appeared
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10138,"to Lot, and are called Gen. 19.13. Men; and to whom, though they were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10139,"but two, Lot speaketh (ver. 18.) as but one, and that one, as God, (for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10140,"the words are, ""Lot said unto them, Oh not so my Lord"") be understood of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10141,"images of men, supernaturally formed in the Fancy; as well as before by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10142,Angel was understood a fancyed Voice? When the Angel called to Abraham
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10143,"out of heaven, to stay his hand (Gen. 22.11.) from slaying Isaac, there"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10144,"was no Apparition, but a Voice; which neverthelesse was called properly"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10145,"enough a Messenger, or Angel of God, because it declared Gods will"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10146,"supernaturally, and saves the labour of supposing any permanent Ghosts."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10147,The Angels which Jacob saw on the Ladder of Heaven (Gen. 28.12.) were
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10148,"a Vision of his sleep; therefore onely Fancy, and a Dream; yet being"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10149,"supernaturall, and signs of Gods Speciall presence, those apparitions"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10150,are not improperly called Angels. The same is to be understood
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10151,"(Gen.31.11.) where Jacob saith thus, ""The Angel of the Lord appeared to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10152,"mee in my sleep."" For an apparition made to a man in his sleep, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10153,"that which all men call a Dreame, whether such Dreame be naturall, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10154,"supernaturall: and that which there Jacob calleth an Angel, was God"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10155,"himselfe; for the same Angel saith (verse 13.) ""I am the God of Bethel."""
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10156,Also (Exod.14.9.) the Angel that went before the Army of Israel to the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10157,"Red Sea, and then came behind it, is (verse 19.) the Lord himself; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10158,"he appeared not in the form of a beautifull man, but in form (by day)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10159,of a Pillar Of Cloud and (by night) in form of a Pillar Of Fire; and yet
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10160,"this Pillar was all the apparition, and Angel promised to Moses (Exod."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10161,"14.9.) for the Armies guide: For this cloudy pillar, is said, to have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10162,"descended, and stood at the dore of the Tabernacle, and to have talked"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10163,with Moses.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10164,"There you see Motion, and Speech, which are commonly attributed to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10165,"Angels, attributed to a Cloud, because the Cloud served as a sign of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10166,"Gods presence; and was no lesse an Angel, then if it had had the form of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10167,"a Man, or Child of never so great beauty; or Wings, as usually they are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10168,"painted, for the false instruction of common people. For it is not the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10169,"shape; but their use, that makes them Angels. But their use is to be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10170,significations of Gods presence in supernaturall operations; As when
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10171,"Moses (Exod. 33.14.) had desired God to goe along with the Campe, (as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10172,"he had done alwaies before the making of the Golden Calfe,) God did not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10173,"answer, ""I will goe,"" nor ""I will send an Angel in my stead;"" but thus,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10174,"""my presence shall goe with thee."""
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10175,To mention all the places of the Old Testament where the name of Angel
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10176,"is found, would be too long. Therefore to comprehend them all at once,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10177,"I say, there is no text in that part of the Old Testament, which the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10178,"Church of England holdeth for Canonicall, from which we can conclude,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10179,"there is, or hath been created, any permanent thing (understood by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10180,"name of Spirit or Angel,) that hath not quantity; and that may not be,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10181,"by the understanding divided; that is to say, considered by parts; so"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10182,"as one part may bee in one place, and the next part in the next place"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10183,"to it; and, in summe, which is not (taking Body for that, which is some"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10184,"what, or some where) Corporeall; but in every place, the sense will bear"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10185,"the interpretation of Angel, for Messenger; as John Baptist is called"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10186,"an Angel, and Christ the Angel of the Covenant; and as (according to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10187,"same Analogy) the Dove, and the Fiery Tongues, in that they were signes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10188,"of Gods speciall presence, might also be called Angels. Though we find"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10189,"in Daniel two names of Angels, Gabriel, and Michael; yet is cleer out of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10190,"the text it selfe, (Dan. 12.1) that by Michael is meant Christ, not as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10191,"an Angel, but as a Prince: and that Gabriel (as the like apparitions"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10192,made to other holy men in their sleep) was nothing but a supernaturall
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10193,"phantasme, by which it seemed to Daniel, in his dream, that two Saints"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10194,"being in talke, one of them said to the other, ""Gabriel, let us make"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10195,"this man understand his Vision:"" For God needeth not, to distinguish"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10196,"his Celestiall servants by names, which are usefull onely to the short"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10197,"memories of Mortalls. Nor in the New Testament is there any place, out"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10198,"of which it can be proved, that Angels (except when they are put for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10199,"such men, as God hath made the Messengers, and Ministers of his word,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10200,"or works) are things permanent, and withall incorporeall. That they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10201,"are permanent, may bee gathered from the words of our Saviour himselfe,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10202,"(Mat. 25.41.) where he saith, it shall be said to the wicked in the last"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10203,"day, ""Go ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10204,"Angels:"" which place is manifest for the permanence of Evill Angels,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10205,(unlesse wee might think the name of Devill and his Angels may be
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10206,understood of the Churches Adversaries and their Ministers;) but then
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10207,it is repugnant to their Immateriality; because Everlasting fire is no
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10208,"punishment to impatible substances, such as are all things Incorporeall."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10209,Angels therefore are not thence proved to be Incorporeall. In like
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10210,"manner where St. Paul sayes (1 Cor. 6.3.) ""Knew ye not that wee shall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10211,"judge the Angels?"" And (2 Pet. 2.4.) ""For if God spared not the Angels"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10212,"that sinned, but cast them down into Hell."" And (Jude 1,6.) ""And the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10213,"Angels that kept not their first estate, but left their owne habitation,"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10218,"the Angels of God in heaven:"" but in the resurrection men shall be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10219,"Permanent, and not Incorporeall; so therefore also are the Angels."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10220,There be divers other places out of which may be drawn the like
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10221,"conclusion. To men that understand the signification of these words,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10222,"Substance, and Incorporeall; as Incorporeall is taken not for subtile"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10223,"body, but for Not Body, they imply a contradiction: insomuch as to say,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10224,"an Angel, or Spirit is (in that sense) an Incorporeall Substance, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10225,"to say in effect, there is no Angel nor Spirit at all. Considering"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10226,"therefore the signification of the word Angel in the Old Testament, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10227,the nature of Dreams and Visions that happen to men by the ordinary way
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10228,"of Nature; I was enclined to this opinion, that Angels were nothing"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10229,"but supernaturall apparitions of the Fancy, raised by the speciall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10230,"and extraordinary operation of God, thereby to make his presence and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10231,"commandements known to mankind, and chiefly to his own people. But the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10232,"many places of the New Testament, and our Saviours own words, and in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10233,"such texts, wherein is no suspicion of corruption of the Scripture, have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10234,"extorted from my feeble Reason, an acknowledgement, and beleef, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10235,"there be also Angels substantiall, and permanent. But to beleeve they be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10236,"in no place, that is to say, no where, that is to say, nothing, as they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10237,"(though indirectly) say, that will have them Incorporeall, cannot by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10238,Scripture bee evinced.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10239,Inspiration What
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10240,"On the signification of the word Spirit, dependeth that of the word"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10241,INSPIRATION; which must either be taken properly; and then it is nothing
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10242,"but the blowing into a man some thin and subtile aire, or wind, in such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10243,manner as a man filleth a bladder with his breath; or if Spirits be not
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10244,"corporeal, but have their existence only in the fancy, it is nothing but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10245,"the blowing in of a Phantasme; which is improper to say, and impossible;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10246,"for Phantasmes are not, but only seem to be somewhat. That word"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10247,therefore is used in the Scripture metaphorically onely: As (Gen. 2.7.)
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10248,"where it is said, that God Inspired into man the breath of life, no more"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10249,"is meant, then that God gave unto him vitall motion. For we are not to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10250,"think that God made first a living breath, and then blew it into Adam"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10251,"after he was made, whether that breath were reall, or seeming; but only"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10252,"as it is (Acts 17.25.) ""that he gave him life and breath;"" that is,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10253,"made him a living creature. And where it is said (2 Tim. 3.16.) ""all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10254,"Scripture is given by Inspiration from God,"" speaking there of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10255,"Scripture of the Old Testament, it is an easie metaphor, to signifie,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10256,"that God enclined the spirit or mind of those Writers, to write that"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,34,10266,was full of the Holy Spirit; yet that Fulnesse is not to be understood

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10470,"height of that throne) were not a Kingdome which God by his Lieutenant,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10471,"or Vicars, who deliver his Commandements to the people, did exercise on"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10472,"Earth; there would not have been so much contention, and warre, about"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10473,"who it is, by whom God speaketh to us; neither would many Priests have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10474,"troubled themselves with Spirituall Jurisdiction, nor any King have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10475,denied it them.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10476,"Out of this literall interpretation of the Kingdome of God, ariseth also"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10477,"the true interpretation of the word HOLY. For it is a word, which in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10478,"Gods Kingdome answereth to that, which men in their Kingdomes use to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10479,"call Publique, or the Kings."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10480,"The King of any Countrey is the Publique Person, or Representative of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10481,all his own Subjects. And God the King of Israel was the Holy One of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10482,"Israel. The Nation which is subject to one earthly Soveraign, is the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10483,"Nation of that Soveraign, that is, of the Publique Person. So the Jews,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10484,"who were Gods Nation, were called (Exod. 19.6.) ""a Holy Nation."" For by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10485,"Holy, is alwaies understood, either God himselfe, or that which is Gods"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10486,"in propriety; as by Publique is alwaies meant, either the Person of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10487,"Common-wealth it self, or something that is so the Common-wealths, as no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10488,private person can claim any propriety therein.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10489,"Therefore the Sabbath (Gods day) is a Holy Day; the Temple, (Gods house)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10490,"a Holy House; Sacrifices, Tithes, and Offerings (Gods tribute) Holy"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10493,Messengers) Holy Angels; and the like: and wheresoever the word Holy is
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10494,"taken properly, there is still something signified of Propriety, gotten"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10495,"by consent. In saying ""Hallowed be thy name,"" we do but pray to God for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10496,"grace to keep the first Commandement, of ""having no other Gods but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10497,"Him."" Mankind is Gods Nation in propriety: but the Jews only were a Holy"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10498,"Nation. Why, but because they became his Propriety by covenant."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10499,Sacred What
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10500,"And the word Profane, is usually taken in the Scripture for the same"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10501,"with Common; and consequently their contraries, Holy, and Proper, in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10502,"Kingdome of God must be the same also. But figuratively, those men also"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10503,"are called Holy, that led such godly lives, as if they had forsaken all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10504,"worldly designes, and wholly devoted, and given themselves to God."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10505,"In the proper sense, that which is made Holy by Gods appropriating or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10506,"separating it to his own use, is said to be Sanctified by God, as the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10507,Seventh day in the fourth Commandement; and as the Elect in the New
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10508,"Testament were said to bee Sanctified, when they were endued with the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10509,Spirit of godlinesse. And that which is made Holy by the dedication of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10510,"men, and given to God, so as to be used onely in his publique service,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10511,"is called also SACRED, and said to be consecrated, as Temples, and other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10512,"Houses of Publique Prayer, and their Utensils, Priests, and Ministers,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10513,"Victimes, Offerings, and the externall matter of Sacraments."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10514,Degrees of Sanctity
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10515,Of Holinesse there be degrees: for of those things that are set apart
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10516,"for the service of God, there may bee some set apart again, for a neerer"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10517,and more especial service. The whole Nation of the Israelites were a
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10518,people Holy to God; yet the tribe of Levi was amongst the Israelites a
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10519,"Holy tribe; and amongst the Levites, the Priests were yet more Holy; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10520,"amongst the Priests, the High Priest was the most Holy. So the Land"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10521,of Judea was the Holy Land; but the Holy City wherein God was to be
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10522,"worshipped, was more Holy; and again, the Temples more Holy than the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10523,City; and the Sanctum Sanctorum more Holy than the rest of the Temple.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10524,Sacrament
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10525,"A SACRAMENT, is a separation of some visible thing from common use;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10526,"and a consecration of it to Gods service, for a sign, either of our"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10527,"admission into the Kingdome of God, to be of the number of his peculiar"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10528,"people, or for a Commemoration of the same. In the Old Testament, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10529,"sign of Admission was Circumcision; in the New Testament, Baptisme. The"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10530,"Commemoration of it in the Old Testament, was the Eating (at a certain"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10531,"time, which was Anniversary) of the Paschall Lamb; by which they were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10532,put in mind of the night wherein they were delivered out of their
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10533,"bondage in Egypt; and in the New Testament, the celebrating of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10534,"Lords Supper; by which, we are put in mind, of our deliverance from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10535,"the bondage of sin, by our Blessed Saviours death upon the crosse. The"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10536,"Sacraments of Admission, are but once to be used, because there needs"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10537,but one Admission; but because we have need of being often put in
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10538,"mind of our deliverance, and of our Allegeance, The Sacraments of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10539,Commemoration have need to be reiterated. And these are the principall
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10540,"Sacraments, and as it were the solemne oathes we make of our"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10541,"Alleageance. There be also other Consecrations, that may be called"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10542,"Sacraments, as the word implyeth onely Consecration to Gods service; but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10543,"as it implies an oath, or promise of Alleageance to God, there were no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10544,"other in the Old Testament, but Circumcision, and the Passover; nor"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,35,10545,"are there any other in the New Testament, but Baptisme, and the Lords"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10575,"That which is here called the Word of god, was the Doctrine of Christian"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10576,Religion; as it appears evidently by that which goes before. And (Acts
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10577,"5.20.) where it is said to the Apostles by an Angel, ""Go stand and speak"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10578,"in the Temple, all the Words of this life;"" by the Words of this life,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10579,"is meant, the Doctrine of the Gospel; as is evident by what they did in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10580,"the Temple, and is expressed in the last verse of the same Chap. ""Daily"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10581,"in the Temple, and in every house they ceased not to teach and preach"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10585,"15.7.) the Word of God, is called the Word of the Gospel, because it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10586,containeth the Doctrine of the Kingdome of Christ; and the same Word
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10587,"(Rom. 10.8,9.) is called the Word of Faith; that is, as is there"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10588,"expressed, the Doctrine of Christ come, and raised from the dead. Also"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10589,"(Mat. 13. 19.) ""When any one heareth the Word of the Kingdome;"" that is,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10590,"the Doctrine of the Kingdome taught by Christ. Again, the same Word, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10591,"said (Acts 12. 24.) ""to grow and to be multiplied;"" which to understand"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10592,"of the Evangelicall Doctrine is easie, but of the Voice, or Speech"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10593,"of God, hard and strange. In the same sense the Doctrine of Devils,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10594,"signifieth not the Words of any Devill, but the Doctrine of Heathen men"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10595,"concerning Daemons, and those Phantasms which they worshipped as Gods."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10596,(1 Tim. 4.1.)
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10597,"Considering these two significations of the WORD OF GOD, as it is taken"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10599,"the Doctrine of the Christian Religion,) that the whole scripture is the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10600,"Word of God: but in the former sense not so. For example, though these"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10601,"words, ""I am the Lord thy God, &c."" to the end of the Ten Commandements,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10602,"were spoken by God to Moses; yet the Preface, ""God spake these words"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10610,"sense it is said (John 1.3.) ""All things were made by it, and without it"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10619,"self, which by his Word is Affirmed, Commanded, Threatned, or Promised;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10620,"as (Psalm 105.19.) where Joseph is said to have been kept in prison,"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10624,thing it self was come to passe. So also (1 King. 18.36.) Elijah saith
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10625,"to God, ""I have done all these thy Words,"" in stead of ""I have done all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10626,"these things at thy Word,"" or commandement: and (Jer. 17.15.) ""Where is"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10642,"from this place, doe commonly call him the Verbe of God, do but render"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10643,the text more obscure. They might as well term him the Nown of God:
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10644,"for as by Nown, so also by Verbe, men understand nothing but a part"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10645,"of speech, a voice, a sound, that neither affirms, nor denies, nor"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10646,"commands, nor promiseth, nor is any substance corporeall, or spirituall;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10647,"and therefore it cannot be said to bee either God, or Man; whereas our"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10648,Saviour is both. And this Word which St. John in his Gospel saith was
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10649,"with God, is (in his 1 Epistle, verse 1.) called ""the Word of Life;"" and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10650,"(verse 2.) ""The eternall life, which was with the Father:"" so that he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10651,"can be in no other sense called the Word, then in that, wherein he is"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10653,by his comming in the flesh. So also (Apocalypse 19.13.) the Apostle
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10654,"speaking of Christ, clothed in a garment dipt in bloud, saith; his name"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10655,"is ""the Word of God;"" which is to be understood, as if he had said his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10656,"name had been, ""He that was come according to the purpose of God from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10657,"the beginning, and according to his Word and promises delivered by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10658,"Prophets."" So that there is nothing here of the Incarnation of a Word,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10659,"but of the Incarnation of God the Son, therefore called the Word,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10660,because his Incarnation was the Performance of the Promise; In like
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10661,manner as the Holy Ghost is called The Promise. (Acts 1.4. Luke 24.49.)

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10677,"mans heart; as Psalm 36.31. Jerem. 31.33. Deut.30.11, 14. and many other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10678,like places.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10679,Divers Acceptions Of The Word Prophet
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10680,"The name of PROPHET, signifieth in Scripture sometimes Prolocutor; that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10681,"is, he that speaketh from God to Man, or from man to God: And sometimes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10682,"Praedictor, or a foreteller of things to come; And sometimes one that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10683,"speaketh incoherently, as men that are distracted. It is most frequently"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10684,"used in the sense of speaking from God to the People. So Moses, Samuel,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10685,"Elijah, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and others were Prophets. And in this sense"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10686,"the High Priest was a Prophet, for he only went into the Sanctum"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10687,"Sanctorum, to enquire of God; and was to declare his answer to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10688,"people. And therefore when Caiphas said, it was expedient that one man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10689,"should die for the people, St. John saith (chap. 11.51.) that ""He spake"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10690,"not this of himselfe, but being High Priest that year, he prophesied"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10691,"that one man should dye for the nation."" Also they that in Christian"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10692,"Congregations taught the people, (1 Cor. 14.3.) are said to Prophecy. In"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10693,"the like sense it is, that God saith to Moses (Exod. 4.16.) concerning"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10694,"Aaron, ""He shall be thy Spokes-man to the People; and he shall be to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10695,"thee a mouth, and thou shalt be to him in stead of God;"" that which here"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10696,"is Spokesman, is (chap.7.1.) interpreted Prophet; ""See (saith God)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10697,"I have made thee a God to Pharaoh, and Aaron thy Brother shall be thy"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10698,"Prophet."" In the sense of speaking from man to God, Abraham is called"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10699,a Prophet (Genes. 20.7.) where God in a Dream speaketh to Abimelech
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10700,"in this manner, ""Now therefore restore the man his wife, for he is a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10701,"Prophet, and shall pray for thee;"" whereby may be also gathered,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10702,"that the name of Prophet may be given, not unproperly to them that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10703,"in Christian Churches, have a Calling to say publique prayers for the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10704,"Congregation. In the same sense, the Prophets that came down from the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10705,"High place (or Hill of God) with a Psaltery, and a Tabret, and a Pipe,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10706,"and a Harp (1 Sam. 10.5,6.) and (vers. 10.) Saul amongst them, are said"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10707,"to Prophecy, in that they praised God, in that manner publiquely. In the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10708,"like sense, is Miriam (Exod. 15.20.) called a Prophetesse. So is it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10709,"also to be taken (1 Cor. 11.4,5.) where St. Paul saith, ""Every man that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10710,"prayeth or prophecyeth with his head covered, &c. and every woman that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10711,prayeth or prophecyeth with her head uncovered: For Prophecy in that
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10712,"place, signifieth no more, but praising God in Psalmes, and Holy Songs;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10713,"which women might doe in the Church, though it were not lawfull for them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10714,"to speak to the Congregation. And in this signification it is, that the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10715,"Poets of the Heathen, that composed Hymnes and other sorts of Poems in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10716,"the honor of their Gods, were called Vates (Prophets) as is well enough"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10717,"known by all that are versed in the Books of the Gentiles, and as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10718,"is evident (Tit. 1.12.) where St. Paul saith of the Cretians, that a"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10720,"their Poets for Prophets, but acknowledgeth that the word Prophet was"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10721,commonly used to signifie them that celebrated the honour of God in

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10725,"Contingents; not only they were Prophets, who were Gods Spokesmen, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10726,"foretold those things to others, which God had foretold to them; but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10727,"also all those Imposters, that pretend by the helpe of familiar spirits,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10728,"or by superstitious divination of events past, from false causes, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10729,foretell the like events in time to come: of which (as I have declared
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10730,"already in the 12. chapter of this Discourse) there be many kinds, who"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10731,"gain in the opinion of the common sort of men, a greater reputation"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10732,"of Prophecy, by one casuall event that may bee but wrested to their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10733,"purpose, than can be lost again by never so many failings. Prophecy is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10734,"not an art, nor (when it is taken for Praediction) a constant Vocation;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10735,"but an extraordinary, and temporary Employment from God, most often of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10736,"Good men, but sometimes also of the Wicked. The woman of Endor, who"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10737,"is said to have had a familiar spirit, and thereby to have raised a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10738,"Phantasme of Samuel, and foretold Saul his death, was not therefore a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10739,"Prophetesse; for neither had she any science, whereby she could raise"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10740,such a Phantasme; nor does it appear that God commanded the raising of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10741,it; but onely guided that Imposture to be a means of Sauls terror and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10742,"discouragement; and by consequent, of the discomfiture, by which he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10743,"fell. And for Incoherent Speech, it was amongst the Gentiles taken for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10744,"one sort of Prophecy, because the Prophets of their Oracles, intoxicated"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10745,"with a spirit, or vapour from the cave of the Pythian Oracle at Delphi,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10746,"were for the time really mad, and spake like mad-men; of whose loose"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10747,"words a sense might be made to fit any event, in such sort, as all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10748,bodies are said to be made of Materia prima. In the Scripture I find
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10749,"it also so taken (1 Sam. 18. 10.) in these words, ""And the Evill spirit"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10750,"came upon Saul, and he Prophecyed in the midst of the house."""
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10751,The Manner How God Hath Spoken To The Prophets
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10752,And although there be so many significations in Scripture of the word
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10753,"Prophet; yet is that the most frequent, in which it is taken for him,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10754,"to whom God speaketh immediately, that which the Prophet is to say from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10755,"him, to some other man, or to the people. And hereupon a question may"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10756,"be asked, in what manner God speaketh to such a Prophet. Can it (may some"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10757,"say) be properly said, that God hath voice and language, when it cannot"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10758,"be properly said, he hath a tongue, or other organs, as a man? The"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10759,"Prophet David argueth thus, ""Shall he that made the eye, not see? or he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10760,"that made the ear, not hear?"" But this may be spoken, not (as usually) to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10761,"signifie Gods nature, but to signifie our intention to honor him. For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10762,"to See, and Hear, are Honorable Attributes, and may be given to God, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10763,declare (as far as our capacity can conceive) his Almighty power. But
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10764,"if it were to be taken in the strict, and proper sense, one might argue"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10765,"from his making of all parts of mans body, that he had also the same use"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10766,"of them which we have; which would be many of them so uncomely, as it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10767,would be the greatest contumely in the world to ascribe them to him.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10768,"Therefore we are to interpret Gods speaking to men immediately, for that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10769,"way (whatsoever it be), by which God makes them understand his will: And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10770,"the wayes whereby he doth this, are many; and to be sought onely in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10771,"Holy Scripture: where though many times it be said, that God spake to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10772,"this, and that person, without declaring in what manner; yet there be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10773,"again many places, that deliver also the signes by which they were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10774,"to acknowledge his presence, and commandement; and by these may be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10775,"understood, how he spake to many of the rest."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10776,To The Extraordinary Prophets Of The Old Testament He Spake
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10777,"By Dreams, Or Visions"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10778,"In what manner God spake to Adam, and Eve, and Cain, and Noah, is not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10779,"expressed; nor how he spake to Abraham, till such time as he came out of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10780,his own countrey to Sichem in the land of Canaan; and then (Gen. 12.7.)
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10781,"God is said to have Appeared to him. So there is one way, whereby God"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10782,"made his presence manifest; that is, by an Apparition, or Vision. And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10783,"again, (Gen. 15.1.) The Word of the Lord came to Abraham in a Vision;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10784,"that is to say, somewhat, as a sign of Gods presence, appeared as Gods"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10785,"Messenger, to speak to him. Again, the Lord appeared to Abraham (Gen."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10786,18. 1.) by an apparition of three Angels; and to Abimelech (Gen. 20. 3.)
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10787,in a dream: To Lot (Gen. 19. 1.) by an apparition of Two Angels: And
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10788,to Hagar (Gen. 21. 17.) by the apparition of one Angel: And to Abraham
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10789,again (Gen. 22. 11.) by the apparition of a voice from heaven: And (Gen.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10790,"26. 24.) to Isaac in the night; (that is, in his sleep, or by dream):"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10791,And to Jacob (Gen. 18. 12.) in a dream; that is to say (as are the words
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10792,"of the text) ""Jacob dreamed that he saw a ladder, &c."" And (Gen. 32. 1.)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10793,in a Vision of Angels: And to Moses (Exod. 3.2.) in the apparition of a
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10794,"flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: And after the time of Moses,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10795,"(where the manner how God spake immediately to man in the Old Testament,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10796,"is expressed) hee spake alwaies by a Vision, or by a Dream; as to"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10806,such manner as a man speaketh to his friend. The words are these (Numb.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10807,"12. 6,7,8.) ""If there be a Prophet among you, I the Lord will make my"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10808,"self known to him in a Vision, and will speak unto him in a Dream. My"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10812,"Lord spake to Moses face to face, as a man speaketh to his friend."""
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10813,"And yet this speaking of God to Moses, was by mediation of an Angel, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10814,"Angels, as appears expressely, Acts 7. ver. 35. and 53. and Gal. 3. 19."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10815,"and was therefore a Vision, though a more cleer Vision than was given to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10816,"other Prophets. And conformable hereunto, where God saith (Deut. 13. 1.)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10817,"""If there arise amongst you a Prophet, or Dreamer of Dreams,"" the later"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10818,"word is but the interpretation of the former. And (Joel 2. 28.) ""Your"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10821,"expounded by Dream, and Vision. And in the same manner it was, that God"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10822,"spake to Solomon, promising him Wisdome, Riches, and Honor; for the text"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10823,"saith, (1 Kings 3. 15.) ""And Solomon awoak, and behold it was a Dream:"""
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10824,So that generally the Prophets extraordinary in the old Testament took
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10825,"notice of the Word of God no otherwise, than from their Dreams, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10826,"Visions, that is to say, from the imaginations which they had in their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10827,"sleep, or in an Extasie; which imaginations in every true Prophet were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10828,"supernaturall; but in false Prophets were either naturall, or feigned."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10829,The same Prophets were neverthelesse said to speak by the Spirit; as
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10830,"(Zach. 7. 12.) where the Prophet speaking of the Jewes, saith, ""They"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10843,"as the Priesthood was Royall; and after the people of the Jews, had"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10844,"rejected God, that he should no more reign over them, those Kings which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10845,"submitted themselves to Gods government, were also his chief Prophets;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10846,and the High Priests office became Ministeriall. And when God was to be
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10847,"consulted, they put on the holy vestments, and enquired of the Lord,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10848,"as the King commanded them, and were deprived of their office, when"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10849,the King thought fit. For King Saul (1 Sam. 13. 9.) commanded the burnt
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10850,"offering to be brought, and (1 Sam. 14. 18.) he commands the Priest to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10851,"bring the Ark neer him; and (ver. 19.) again to let it alone, because he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10852,saw an advantage upon his enemies. And in the same chapter Saul asketh
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10853,"counsell of God. In like manner King David, after his being anointed,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10854,"though before he had possession of the Kingdome, is said to ""enquire"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10855,"of the Lord"" (1 Sam. 23. 2.) whether he should fight against the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10856,Philistines at Keilah; and (verse 10.) David commandeth the Priest to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10857,"bring him the Ephod, to enquire whether he should stay in Keilah,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10858,or not. And King Solomon (1 Kings 2. 27.) took the Priesthood from
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10859,"Abiathar, and gave it (verse 35.) to Zadoc. Therefore Moses, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10860,"the High Priests, and the pious Kings, who enquired of God on all"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10863,"God spake unto them, is not manifest. To say that when Moses went up to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10864,"God in Mount Sinai, it was a Dream, or Vision, such as other Prophets"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10865,"had, is contrary to that distinction which God made between Moses, and"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10868,"Incomprehensibility. To say he spake by Inspiration, or Infusion of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10869,"Holy Spirit, as the Holy Spirit signifieth the Deity, is to make Moses"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10879,"to the High Priests, from the Mercy-Seat. Therefore in what manner God"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10880,"spake to those Soveraign Prophets of the Old Testament, whose office"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10881,"it was to enquire of him, is not intelligible. In the time of the New"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10882,"Testament, there was no Soveraign Prophet, but our Saviour; who was both"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10883,"God that spake, and the Prophet to whom he spake."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10884,"To Prophets Of Perpetuall Calling, But Subordinate, God Spake By The"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10885,"Spirit. To subordinate Prophets of perpetuall Calling, I find not any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10886,place that proveth God spake to them supernaturally; but onely in
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10887,"such manner, as naturally he inclineth men to Piety, to Beleef, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10888,"Righteousnesse, and to other vertues all other Christian Men. Which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10889,"way, though it consist in Constitution, Instruction, Education, and the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10890,occasions and invitements men have to Christian vertues; yet it is truly
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10891,"attributed to the operation of the Spirit of God, or Holy Spirit"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10892,(which we in our language call the Holy Ghost): For there is no good
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10893,"inclination, that is not of the operation of God. But these operations"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10894,are not alwaies supernaturall. When therefore a Prophet is said to speak
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10895,"in the Spirit, or by the Spirit of God, we are to understand no more,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10896,"but that he speaks according to Gods will, declared by the supreme"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10897,"Prophet. For the most common acceptation of the word Spirit, is in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10898,"signification of a mans intention, mind, or disposition."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10899,"In the time of Moses, there were seventy men besides himself, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10900,Prophecyed in the Campe of the Israelites. In what manner God spake to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10901,"them, is declared in the 11 of Numbers, verse 25. ""The Lord came down in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10902,"a cloud, and spake unto Moses, and took of the Spirit that was upon him,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10903,"and gave it to the seventy Elders. And it came to passe, when the Spirit"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10904,"rested upon them, they Prophecyed, and did not cease,"" By which it is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10905,"manifest, first, that their Prophecying to the people, was subservient,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10906,and subordinate to the Prophecying of Moses; for that God took of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10907,"Spirit of Moses, to put upon them; so that they Prophecyed as Moses"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10908,would have them: otherwise they had not been suffered to Prophecy at
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10909,all. For there was (verse 27.) a complaint made against them to Moses;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10910,"and Joshua would have Moses to have forbidden them; which he did not,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10911,"but said to Joshua, Bee not jealous in my behalf. Secondly, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10912,"the Spirit of God in that place, signifieth nothing but the Mind and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10913,"Disposition to obey, and assist Moses in the administration of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10914,Government. For if it were meant they had the substantial Spirit of God;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10915,"that is, the Divine nature, inspired into them, then they had it in no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10916,"lesse manner than Christ himself, in whom onely the Spirit of God dwelt"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10917,"bodily. It is meant therefore of the Gift and Grace of God, that guided"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10918,them to co-operate with Moses; from whom their Spirit was derived. And
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10919,"it appeareth (verse 16.) that, they were such as Moses himself should"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10920,"appoint for Elders and Officers of the People: For the words are,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10921,"""Gather unto me seventy men, whom thou knowest to be Elders and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10922,"Officers of the people:"" where, ""thou knowest,"" is the same with ""thou"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10923,"appointest,"" or ""hast appointed to be such."" For we are told"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10924,before (Exod. 18.) that Moses following the counsell of Jethro his
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10925,"Father-in-law, did appoint Judges, and Officers over the people, such as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10926,"feared God; and of these, were those Seventy, whom God by putting upon"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10927,"them Moses spirit, inclined to aid Moses in the Administration of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10928,"Kingdome: and in this sense the Spirit of God is said (1 Sam. 16. 13,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10929,"14.) presently upon the anointing of David, to have come upon David, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10930,"left Saul; God giving his graces to him he chose to govern his people,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10931,"and taking them away from him, he rejected. So that by the Spirit is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10932,meant Inclination to Gods service; and not any supernaturall Revelation.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10933,God Sometimes Also Spake By Lots
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10934,God spake also many times by the event of Lots; which were ordered by
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10935,such as he had put in Authority over his people. So wee read that God
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10936,manifested by the Lots which Saul caused to be drawn (1 Sam. 14. 43.)
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10937,"the fault that Jonathan had committed, in eating a honey-comb, contrary"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10938,to the oath taken by the people. And (Josh. 18. 10.) God divided the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10939,"land of Canaan amongst the Israelite, by the ""lots that Joshua did cast"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10940,"before the Lord in Shiloh."" In the same manner it seemeth to be, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10941,"God discovered (Joshua 7.16., &c.) the crime of Achan. And these are the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10942,wayes whereby God declared his Will in the Old Testament.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10943,"All which ways he used also in the New Testament. To the Virgin Mary, by"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10958,"also by his naturall operation, and by mediation of second causes;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10959,"there is need of Reason and Judgement to discern between naturall, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10960,"supernaturall Gifts, and between naturall, and supernaturall Visions, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10961,"Dreams. And consequently men had need to be very circumspect, and wary,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10962,"in obeying the voice of man, that pretending himself to be a Prophet,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10963,"requires us to obey God in that way, which he in Gods name telleth us to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10964,be the way to happinesse. For he that pretends to teach men the way of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10965,"so great felicity, pretends to govern them; that is to say, to rule, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10966,"reign over them; which is a thing, that all men naturally desire, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10967,is therefore worthy to be suspected of Ambition and Imposture; and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10968,"consequently, ought to be examined, and tryed by every man, before hee"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,10972,"of Prophets, and Spirits, were not allowed to every one of the people,"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,11004,conformable doctrine to that which Moses the Soveraign Prophet had
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,11005,taught them; and the other the miraculous power of foretelling what God
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,11006,"would bring to passe, as I have already shown out of Deut. 13. 1. &c."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,11007,and in the New Testament there was but one onely mark; and that was the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,11008,"preaching of this Doctrine, That Jesus Is The Christ, that is, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,11009,"King of the Jews, promised in the Old Testament. Whosoever denyed that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,11010,"Article, he was a false Prophet, whatsoever miracles he might seem to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,11011,"work; and he that taught it was a true Prophet. For St. John (1 Epist,"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,11013,"they be of God, or not; after he hath told them that there would arise"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,11014,"false Prophets, saith thus, ""Hereby know ye the Spirit of God. Every"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,11015,"Spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,11016,"God;"" that is, is approved and allowed as a Prophet of God: not that"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,11019,"Prophet avowed. For God sometimes speaketh by Prophets, whose persons he"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,36,11022,"that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the Flesh, is not"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11053,By Miracles are signified the Admirable works of God: & therefore they

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11060,"that, which the Almighty is about to bring to passe."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11061,"And Must Therefore Be Rare, Whereof There Is No Naturall Cause Known"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11062,"To understand therefore what is a Miracle, we must first understand what"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11063,"works they are, which men wonder at, and call Admirable. And there be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11064,"but two things which make men wonder at any event: The one is, if it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11065,"be strange, that is to say, such, as the like of it hath never, or very"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11066,"rarely been produced: The other is, if when it is produced, we cannot"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11067,"imagine it to have been done by naturall means, but onely by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11068,"immediate hand of God. But when wee see some possible, naturall cause of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11069,"it, how rarely soever the like has been done; or if the like have been"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11070,"often done, how impossible soever it be to imagine a naturall means"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11071,"thereof, we no more wonder, nor esteem it for a Miracle."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11072,"Therefore, if a Horse, or Cow should speak, it were a Miracle; because"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11073,"both the thing is strange, & the Naturall cause difficult to imagin: So"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11074,"also were it, to see a strange deviation of nature, in the production"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11075,"of some new shape of a living creature. But when a man, or other Animal,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11076,"engenders his like, though we know no more how this is done, than the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11077,"other; yet because 'tis usuall, it is no Miracle. In like manner, if a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11078,"man be metamorphosed into a stone, or into a pillar, it is a Miracle;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11079,because strange: but if a peece of wood be so changed; because we see it
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11080,"often, it is no Miracle: and yet we know no more, by what operation of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11081,"God, the one is brought to passe, than the other."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11082,"The first Rainbow that was seen in the world, was a Miracle, because the"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11088,rare works produced by the Art of man: yet when we know they are done;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11089,"because thereby wee know also the means how they are done, we count them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11090,"not for Miracles, because not wrought by the immediate hand of God, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11091,by mediation of humane Industry.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11092,"That Which Seemeth A Miracle To One Man, May Seem Otherwise To Another"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11093,"Furthermore, seeing Admiration and Wonder, is consequent to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11094,"knowledge and experience, wherewith men are endued, some more, some"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11095,"lesse; it followeth, that the same thing, may be a Miracle to one, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11096,"not to another. And thence it is, that ignorant, and superstitious men"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11097,"make great Wonders of those works, which other men, knowing to proceed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11098,"from Nature, (which is not the immediate, but the ordinary work of God,)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11099,admire not at all: As when Ecclipses of the Sun and Moon have been taken
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11100,"for supernaturall works, by the common people; when neverthelesse, there"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11101,"were others, could from their naturall causes, have foretold the very"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11102,"hour they should arrive: Or, as when a man, by confederacy, and secret"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11103,"intelligence, getting knowledge of the private actions of an ignorant,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11104,"unwary man, thereby tells him, what he has done in former time; it seems"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11105,"to him a Miraculous thing; but amongst wise, and cautelous men, such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11106,"Miracles as those, cannot easily be done."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11107,The End Of Miracles
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11108,"Again, it belongeth to the nature of a Miracle, that it be wrought for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11109,"the procuring of credit to Gods Messengers, Ministers, and Prophets,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11110,"that thereby men may know, they are called, sent, and employed by God,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11111,"and thereby be the better inclined to obey them. And therefore, though"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11112,"the creation of the world, and after that the destruction of all living"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11113,"creatures in the universall deluge, were admirable works; yet because"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11114,"they were not done to procure credit to any Prophet, or other Minister"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11115,"of God, they use not to be called Miracles. For how admirable soever any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11116,"work be, the Admiration consisteth not in that it could be done, because"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11117,"men naturally beleeve the Almighty can doe all things, but because he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11118,"does it at the Prayer, or Word of a man. But the works of God in Egypt,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11119,"by the hand of Moses, were properly Miracles; because they were done"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11120,"with intention to make the people of Israel beleeve, that Moses came"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11121,"unto them, not out of any design of his owne interest, but as sent from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11122,God. Therefore after God had commanded him to deliver the Israelites
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11123,"from the Egyptian bondage, when he said (Exod 4.1. &c.) ""They will not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11124,"beleeve me, but will say, the Lord hath not appeared unto me,"" God gave"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11125,"him power, to turn the Rod he had in his hand into a Serpent, and again"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11126,"to return it into a Rod; and by putting his hand into his bosome, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11127,"make it leprous; and again by pulling it out to make it whole, to make"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11128,the Children of Israel beleeve (as it is verse 5.) that the God of their
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11129,"Fathers had appeared unto him; And if that were not enough, he gave"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11130,him power to turn their waters into bloud. And when hee had done these
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11131,"Miracles before the people, it is said (verse 41.) that ""they beleeved"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11132,"him."" Neverthelesse, for fear of Pharaoh, they durst not yet obey him."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11133,Therefore the other works which were done to plague Pharaoh and the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11134,"Egyptians, tended all to make the Israelites beleeve in Moses, and were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11135,properly Miracles. In like manner if we consider all the Miracles
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11136,"done by the hand of Moses, and all the rest of the Prophets, till the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11137,"Captivity; and those of our Saviour, and his Apostles afterward; we"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11138,"shall find, their end was alwaies to beget, or confirm beleefe, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11139,"they came not of their own motion, but were sent by God. Wee may further"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11140,"observe in Scripture, that the end of Miracles, was to beget beleef,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11141,"not universally in all men, elect, and reprobate; but in the elect"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11142,"only; that is to say, is such as God had determined should become his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11143,"Subjects. For those miraculous plagues of Egypt, had not for end, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11144,"conversion of Pharaoh; For God had told Moses before, that he would"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11145,"harden the heart of Pharaoh, that he should not let the people goe: And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11146,"when he let them goe at last, not the Miracles perswaded him, but the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11147,"plagues forced him to it. So also of our Saviour, it is written, (Mat."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11148,"13. 58.) that he wrought not many Miracles in his own countrey, because"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11149,"of their unbeleef; and (in Marke 6.5.) in stead of, ""he wrought not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11150,"many,"" it is, ""he could work none."" It was not because he wanted power;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11151,"which to say, were blasphemy against God; nor that the end of Miracles"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11152,was not to convert incredulous men to Christ; for the end of all the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11153,"Miracles of Moses, of Prophets, of our Saviour, and of his Apostles"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11154,"was to adde men to the Church; but it was, because the end of their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11155,"Miracles, was to adde to the Church (not all men, but) such as should"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11156,"be saved; that is to say, such as God had elected. Seeing therefore"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11157,"our Saviour sent from his Father, hee could not use his power in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11158,"conversion of those, whom his Father had rejected. They that expounding"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11159,"this place of St. Marke, say, that his word, ""Hee could not,"" is put"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11160,"for, ""He would not,"" do it without example in the Greek tongue, (where"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11161,"Would Not, is put sometimes for Could Not, in things inanimate, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11162,"have no will; but Could Not, for Would Not, never,) and thereby lay"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11163,a stumbling block before weak Christians; as if Christ could doe no
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11164,"Miracles, but amongst the credulous."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11165,The Definition Of A Miracle
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11166,"From that which I have here set down, of the nature, and use of a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11167,"Miracle, we may define it thus, ""A MIRACLE, is a work of God, (besides"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11168,"his operation by the way of Nature, ordained in the Creation,) done"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11169,"for the making manifest to his elect, the mission of an extraordinary"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11170,"Minister for their salvation."""
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11171,"And from this definition, we may inferre; First, that in all Miracles,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11172,"the work done, is not the effect of any vertue in the Prophet; because"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11173,it is the effect of the immediate hand of God; that is to say God hath
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11174,"done it, without using the Prophet therein, as a subordinate cause."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11175,"Secondly, that no Devil, Angel, or other created Spirit, can do a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11176,"Miracle. For it must either be by vertue of some naturall science, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11177,"by Incantation, that is, vertue of words. For if the Inchanters do it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11178,"by their own power independent, there is some power that proceedeth not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11179,"from God; which all men deny: and if they doe it by power given them,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11180,"then is the work not from the immediate hand of God, but naturall, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11181,consequently no Miracle.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11182,"There be some texts of Scripture, that seem to attribute the power of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11183,"working wonders (equall to some of those immediate Miracles, wrought"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11184,"by God himself,) to certain Arts of Magick, and Incantation. As for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11185,"example, when we read that after the Rod of Moses being cast on the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11186,"ground became a Serpent, (Exod. 7. 11.) ""the Magicians of Egypt did the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11187,"like by their Enchantments;"" and that after Moses had turned the waters"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11188,"of the Egyptian Streams, Rivers, Ponds, and Pooles of water into blood,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11189,"(Exod. 7. 22.) ""the Magicians of Egypt did so likewise, with their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11190,"Enchantments;"" and that after Moses had by the power of God brought"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11191,"frogs upon the land, (Exod. 8. 7.) ""the Magicians also did so with their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11192,"Enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt;"" will not a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11193,"man be apt to attribute Miracles to Enchantments; that is to say, to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11194,efficacy of the sound of Words; and think the same very well proved out
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11195,"of this, and other such places? and yet there is no place of Scripture,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11196,"that telleth us what on Enchantment is. If therefore Enchantment be not,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11197,"as many think it, a working of strange effects by spells, and words;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11198,"but Imposture, and delusion, wrought by ordinary means; and so far"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11199,"from supernaturall, as the Impostors need not the study so much as of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11200,"naturall causes, but the ordinary ignorance, stupidity, and superstition"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11201,"of mankind, to doe them; those texts that seem to countenance the power"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11202,"of Magick, Witchcraft, and Enchantment, must needs have another sense,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11203,than at first sight they seem to bear.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11204,That Men Are Apt To Be Deceived By False Miracles
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11205,"For it is evident enough, that Words have no effect, but on those"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11206,"that understand them; and then they have no other, but to signifie the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11207,"intentions, or passions of them that speak; and thereby produce, hope,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11208,"fear, or other passions, or conceptions in the hearer. Therefore when a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11209,"Rod seemeth a Serpent, or the Water Bloud, or any other Miracle seemeth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11210,"done by Enchantment; if it be not to the edification of Gods people,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11211,"not the Rod, nor the Water, nor any other thing is enchanted; that is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11212,"to say, wrought upon by the Words, but the Spectator. So that all the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11213,"Miracle consisteth in this, that the Enchanter has deceived a man; which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11214,"is no Miracle, but a very easie matter to doe."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11215,"For such is the ignorance, and aptitude to error generally of all men,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11216,"but especially of them that have not much knowledge of naturall causes,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11217,"and of the nature, and interests of men; as by innumerable and easie"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11218,"tricks to be abused. What opinion of miraculous power, before it was"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11219,"known there was a Science of the course of the Stars, might a man have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11220,"gained, that should have told the people, This hour, or day the Sun"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11221,"should be darkned? A juggler by the handling of his goblets, and other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11222,"trinkets, if it were not now ordinarily practised, would be thought"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11223,to do his wonders by the power at least of the Devil. A man that hath
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11224,"practised to speak by drawing in of his breath, (which kind of men in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11225,"antient time were called Ventriloqui,) and so make the weaknesse of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11226,"his voice seem to proceed, not from the weak impulsion of the organs"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11227,"of Speech, but from distance of place, is able to make very many men"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11228,"beleeve it is a voice from Heaven, whatsoever he please to tell them."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11229,"And for a crafty man, that hath enquired into the secrets, and familiar"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11230,confessions that one man ordinarily maketh to another of his actions and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11231,"adventures past, to tell them him again is no hard matter; and yet there"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11232,"be many, that by such means as that, obtain the reputation of being"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11233,"Conjurers. But it is too long a businesse, to reckon up the severall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11234,"sorts of those men, which the Greeks called Thaumaturgi, that is to say,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11235,"workers of things wonderfull; and yet these do all they do, by their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11236,own single dexterity. But if we looke upon the Impostures wrought by
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11237,"Confederacy, there is nothing how impossible soever to be done, that is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11238,"impossible to bee beleeved. For two men conspiring, one to seem lame,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11239,"the other to cure him with a charme, will deceive many: but many"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11240,"conspiring, one to seem lame, another so to cure him, and all the rest"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11241,to bear witnesse; will deceive many more.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11242,Cautions Against The Imposture Of Miracles
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11243,"In this aptitude of mankind, to give too hasty beleefe to pretended"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11244,"Miracles, there can be no better, nor I think any other caution, than"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11245,"that which God hath prescribed, first by Moses, (as I have said before"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11246,"in the precedent chapter,) in the beginning of the 13. and end of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11247,"18. of Deuteronomy; That wee take not any for Prophets, that teach any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11248,"other Religion, then that which Gods Lieutenant, (which at that time was"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11250,whose Praediction we doe not see come to passe. Moses therefore in his
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11251,"time, and Aaron, and his successors in their times, and the Soveraign"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11252,"Governour of Gods people, next under God himself, that is to say, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11253,"Head of the Church in all times, are to be consulted, what doctrine"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11254,"he hath established, before wee give credit to a pretended Miracle, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11255,"Prophet. And when that is done, the thing they pretend to be a Miracle,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11256,"we must both see it done, and use all means possible to consider,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11257,"whether it be really done; and not onely so, but whether it be such, as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11258,"no man can do the like by his naturall power, but that it requires the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11259,immediate hand of God. And in this also we must have recourse to Gods
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11260,"Lieutenant; to whom in all doubtfull cases, wee have submitted our"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11261,"private judgments. For Example; if a man pretend, that after certain"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11262,"words spoken over a peece of bread, that presently God hath made it not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11263,"bread, but a God, or a man, or both, and neverthelesse it looketh still"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11264,as like bread as ever it did; there is no reason for any man to think
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11265,"it really done; nor consequently to fear him, till he enquire of God,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11266,"by his Vicar, or Lieutenant, whether it be done, or not. If he say not,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11267,"then followeth that which Moses saith, (Deut. 18. 22.) ""he hath spoken"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11268,"it presumptuously, thou shalt not fear him."" If he say 'tis done, then"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11269,"he is not to contradict it. So also if wee see not, but onely hear tell"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11270,"of a Miracle, we are to consult the Lawful Church; that is to say, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11271,"lawful Head thereof, how far we are to give credit to the relators of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11272,"it. And this is chiefly the case of men, that in these days live under"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11273,"Christian Soveraigns. For in these times, I do not know one man, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11274,"ever saw any such wondrous work, done by the charm, or at the word,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11275,"or prayer of a man, that a man endued but with a mediocrity of reason,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11276,"would think supernaturall: and the question is no more, whether what wee"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11277,"see done, be a Miracle; whether the Miracle we hear, or read of, were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11278,"a reall work, and not the Act of a tongue, or pen; but in plain terms,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11279,"whether the report be true, or a lye. In which question we are not every"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11280,"one, to make our own private Reason, or Conscience, but the Publique"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11281,"Reason, that is, the reason of Gods Supreme Lieutenant, Judge; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11282,"indeed we have made him Judge already, if wee have given him a Soveraign"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11283,"power, to doe all that is necessary for our peace and defence. A private"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11284,"man has alwaies the liberty, (because thought is free,) to beleeve,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,37,11285,"or not beleeve in his heart, those acts that have been given out for"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,38,11351,"where he saith, ""I John saw the Holy City, New Jerusalem, coming down"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,38,11408,"in Heaven, but upon the Earth. The like is said of David (Acts 2.34.)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,38,11409,"where St. Peter, to prove the Ascension of Christ, using the words of"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,38,11413,"David is not ascended into Heaven."" But to this a man may easily answer,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,38,11414,"and say, that though their bodies were not to ascend till the generall"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,38,11416,departed from their bodies; which also seemeth to be confirmed by the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,38,11417,"words of our Saviour (Luke 20.37,38.) who proving the Resurrection out"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,38,11418,"of the word of Moses, saith thus, ""That the dead are raised, even Moses"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,38,11419,"shewed, at the bush, when he calleth the Lord, the God of Abraham, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,38,11420,"the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. For he is not a God of the Dead,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,38,11421,"but of the Living; for they all live to him."" But if these words be to"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,38,11570,"followeth, me thinks, very necessarily, that that which is thus said"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,38,11571,"concerning Hell Fire, is spoken metaphorically; and that therefore there"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,38,11583,thereby they seem to be the proper names of Daemons; and men are the

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,38,11592,before the Jews had deposed God. For Gods Kingdome was in Palestine;

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,38,11596,"The Torments of Hell, are expressed sometimes, by ""weeping, and gnashing"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,38,11616,"that ""the body is sown in corruption, and is raised in incorruption; It"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,38,11622,cannot well be understood of a Second Death. The fire prepared for the

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,38,11624,"no man can be without torture, both of body and mind, after the"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,38,11631,(into which men may be cast successively one after another for ever;)
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,38,11632,yet I find none that affirm there shall bee an Eternall Life therein of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,38,11633,"any individuall person; but on the contrary, an Everlasting Death, which"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,38,11659,"that form of speech, onely to shew he had power to forgive Sins. And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,38,11660,"it is besides evident in reason, that since Death and Misery, were the"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,38,11717,as the Children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessell into

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,38,11722,"confirmed by our Saviour, in his discourse with the woman of Samaria,"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,38,11730,"that which our saviour saith, ""Salvation is from the Jews,"" is the"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11809,CHAPTER XXXIX. OF THE SIGNIFICATION IN SCRIPTURE OF THE WORD CHURCH
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11810,Church The Lords House
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11811,"The word Church, (Ecclesia) signifieth in the Books of Holy Scripture"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11812,"divers things. Sometimes (though not often) it is taken for Gods House,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11813,"that is to say, for a Temple, wherein Christians assemble to perform"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11814,"holy duties publiquely; as, 1 Cor. 14. ver. 34. ""Let your women keep"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11815,"silence in the Churches:"" but this is Metaphorically put, for the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11816,Congregation there assembled; and hath been since used for the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11817,"Edifice it self, to distinguish between the Temples of Christians, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11818,"Idolaters. The Temple of Jerusalem was Gods House, and the House of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11819,Prayer; and so is any Edifice dedicated by Christians to the worship of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11820,"Christ, Christs House: and therefore the Greek Fathers call it Kuriake,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11821,"The Lords House; and thence, in our language it came to be called Kyrke,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11822,and Church.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11823,Ecclesia Properly What
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11824,Church (when not taken for a House) signifieth the same that Ecclesia
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11825,"signified in the Grecian Common-wealths; that is to say, a Congregation,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11826,"or an Assembly of Citizens, called forth, to hear the Magistrate speak"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11827,"unto them; and which in the Common-wealth of Rome was called Concio, as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11828,"he that spake was called Ecclesiastes, and Concionator. And when they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11829,"were called forth by lawfull Authority, (Acts 19.39.) it was Ecclesia"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11830,"Legitima, a Lawfull Church, Ennomos Ecclesia. But when they were excited"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11831,"by tumultuous, and seditious clamor, then it was a confused Church,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11832,Ecclesia Sugkechumene.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11833,It is taken also sometimes for the men that have right to be of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11834,"Congregation, though not actually assembled; that is to say, for the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11835,"whole multitude of Christian men, how far soever they be dispersed: as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11836,"(Act. 8.3.) where it is said, that ""Saul made havock of the Church:"" And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11837,in this sense is Christ said to be Head of the Church. And sometimes for
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11838,"a certain part of Christians, as (Col. 4.15.) ""Salute the Church that is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11839,"in his house."" Sometimes also for the Elect onely; as (Ephes. 5.27.) ""A"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11840,"Glorious Church, without spot, or wrinkle, holy, and without blemish;"""
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11841,"which is meant of the Church Triumphant, or, Church To Come. Sometimes,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11842,"for a Congregation assembled, of professors of Christianity, whether"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11844,"18.17. where it is said, ""Tell it to the Church, and if hee neglect to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11845,"hear the Church, let him be to thee as a Gentile, or Publican."""
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11846,In What Sense The Church Is One Person Church Defined
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11847,And in this last sense only it is that the Church can be taken for one
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11848,"Person; that is to say, that it can be said to have power to will, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11849,"pronounce, to command, to be obeyed, to make laws, or to doe any other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11850,"action whatsoever; For without authority from a lawfull Congregation,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11851,"whatsoever act be done in a concourse of people, it is the particular"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11852,"act of every one of those that were present, and gave their aid to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11853,"performance of it; and not the act of them all in grosse, as of one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11854,"body; much lesse that act of them that were absent, or that being"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11855,"present, were not willing it should be done. According to this sense, I"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11856,"define a CHURCH to be, ""A company of men professing Christian Religion,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11857,united in the person of one Soveraign; at whose command they ought to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11858,"assemble, and without whose authority they ought not to assemble."" And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11859,"because in all Common-wealths, that Assembly, which is without warrant"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11860,"from the Civil Soveraign, is unlawful; that Church also, which is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11861,"assembled in any Common-wealth, that hath forbidden them to assemble, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11862,an unlawfull Assembly.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11863,"A Christian Common-wealth, And A Church All One"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11864,"It followeth also, that there is on Earth, no such universall Church as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11865,"all Christians are bound to obey; because there is no power on Earth, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11866,"which all other Common-wealths are subject: There are Christians, in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11867,the Dominions of severall Princes and States; but every one of them
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11868,"is subject to that Common-wealth, whereof he is himself a member; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11869,"consequently, cannot be subject to the commands of any other Person."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11870,"And therefore a Church, such as one as is capable to Command, to Judge,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11871,"Absolve, Condemn, or do any other act, is the same thing with a Civil"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11872,"Common-wealth, consisting of Christian men; and is called a Civill"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11873,"State, for that the subjects of it are Men; and a Church, for that the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11874,"subjects thereof are Christians. Temporall and Spirituall Government,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11875,"are but two words brought into the world, to make men see double, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11876,"mistake their Lawfull Soveraign. It is true, that the bodies of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11877,"faithfull, after the Resurrection shall be not onely Spirituall, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11878,"Eternall; but in this life they are grosse, and corruptible. There"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,39,11879,"is therefore no other Government in this life, neither of State, nor"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11897,AND THE KINGS OF JUDAH
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11898,The Soveraign Rights Of Abraham
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11899,"The Father of the Faithfull, and first in the Kingdome of God by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11900,"Covenant, was Abraham. For with him was the Covenant first made; wherein"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11901,"he obliged himself, and his seed after him, to acknowledge and obey the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11902,"commands of God; not onely such, as he could take notice of, (as Morall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11903,"Laws,) by the light of Nature; but also such, as God should in speciall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11904,"manner deliver to him by Dreams and Visions. For as to the Morall law,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11905,"they were already obliged, and needed not have been contracted withall,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11906,"by promise of the Land of Canaan. Nor was there any Contract, that could"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11907,"adde to, or strengthen the Obligation, by which both they, and all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11908,men else were bound naturally to obey God Almighty: And therefore the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11909,"Covenant which Abraham made with God, was to take for the Commandement"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11910,"of God, that which in the name of God was commanded him, in a Dream, or"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11913,Abraham Had The Sole Power Of Ordering The Religion Of His Own People
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11914,"In this Contract of God with Abraham, wee may observe three points of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11915,"important consequence in the government of Gods people. First, that at"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11916,"the making of this Covenant, God spake onely to Abraham; and therefore"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11919,involved in the will of Abraham; who was therefore supposed to have had
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11920,"a lawfull power, to make them perform all that he covenanted for them."

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11924,"Lord."" From whence may be concluded this first point, that they to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11925,"whom God hath not spoken immediately, are to receive the positive"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11926,"commandements of God, from their Soveraign; as the family and seed of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11927,"Abraham did from Abraham their Father, and Lord, and Civill Soveraign."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11928,"And Consequently in every Common-wealth, they who have no supernaturall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11929,"Revelation to the contrary, ought to obey the laws of their own"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11930,"Soveraign, in the externall acts and profession of Religion. As for the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11931,"inward Thought, and beleef of men, which humane Governours can take no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11932,"notice of, (for God onely knoweth the heart) they are not voluntary, nor"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11933,"the effect of the laws, but of the unrevealed will, and of the power of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11934,God; and consequently fall not under obligation.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11935,No Pretence Of Private Spirit Against The Religion Of Abraham
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11936,"From whence proceedeth another point, that it was not unlawfull for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11937,"Abraham, when any of his Subjects should pretend Private Vision, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11938,"Spirit, or other Revelation from God, for the countenancing of any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11939,"doctrine which Abraham should forbid, or when they followed, or adhered"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11940,"to any such pretender, to punish them; and consequently that it is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11941,lawfull now for the Soveraign to punish any man that shall oppose his
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11942,Private Spirit against the Laws: For hee hath the same place in the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11943,"Common-wealth, that Abraham had in his own Family."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11944,"Abraham Sole Judge, And Interpreter Of What God Spake"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11945,"There ariseth also from the same, a third point; that as none but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11946,"Abraham in his family, so none but the Soveraign in a Christian"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11947,"Common-wealth, can take notice what is, or what is not the Word of God."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11948,"For God spake onely to Abraham; and it was he onely, that was able"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11949,"to know what God said, and to interpret the same to his family: And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11950,"therefore also, they that have the place of Abraham in a Common-wealth,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11951,are the onely Interpreters of what God hath spoken.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11952,The Authority Of Moses Whereon Grounded
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11953,The same Covenant was renewed with Isaac; and afterwards with Jacob; but
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11954,"afterwards no more, till the Israelites were freed from the Egyptians,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11955,and arrived at the Foot of Mount Sinai: and then it was renewed by Moses
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11956,"(as I have said before, chap. 35.) in such manner, as they became from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11957,that time forward the Peculiar Kingdome of God; whose Lieutenant was
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11958,"Moses, for his owne time; and the succession to that office was setled"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11959,"upon Aaron, and his heirs after him, to bee to God a Sacerdotall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11960,Kingdome for ever.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11961,"By this constitution, a Kingdome is acquired to God. But seeing Moses"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11962,"had no authority to govern the Israelites, as a successor to the right"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11963,"of Abraham, because he could not claim it by inheritance; it appeareth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11964,"not as yet, that the people were obliged to take him for Gods"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11965,"Lieutenant, longer than they beleeved that God spake unto him. And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11966,therefore his authority (notwithstanding the Covenant they made with
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11967,"God) depended yet merely upon the opinion they had of his Sanctity,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11968,"and of the reality of his Conferences with God, and the verity of his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11969,"Miracles; which opinion coming to change, they were no more obliged to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11970,"take any thing for the law of God, which he propounded to them in Gods"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11971,"name. We are therefore to consider, what other ground there was, of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11972,their obligation to obey him. For it could not be the commandement of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11973,"God that could oblige them; because God spake not to them immediately,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11974,"but by the mediation of Moses Himself; And our Saviour saith of himself,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11975,"(John 5. 31.) ""If I bear witnesse of my self, my witnesse is not true,"""
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11976,"much lesse if Moses bear witnesse of himselfe, (especially in a claim of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11977,Kingly power over Gods people) ought his testimony to be received. His
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11978,"authority therefore, as the authority of all other Princes, must be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11979,"grounded on the Consent of the People, and their Promise to obey him."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11980,"And so it was: for ""the people"" (Exod. 20.18.) ""when they saw the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11981,"Thunderings, and the Lightnings, and the noyse of the Trumpet, and the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11982,"mountaine smoaking, removed, and stood a far off. And they said unto"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11983,"Moses, speak thou with us, and we will hear, but let not God speak with"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11984,"us lest we die."" Here was their promise of obedience; and by this it was"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11985,they obliged themselves to obey whatsoever he should deliver unto them
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11986,for the Commandement of God.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11987,"Moses Was (Under God) Soveraign Of The Jews, All His Own Time,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11988,Though Aaron Had The Priesthood
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11989,"And notwithstanding the Covenant constituted a Sacerdotall Kingdome,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11990,"that is to say, a Kingdome hereditary to Aaron; yet that is to be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11991,"understood of the succession, after Moses should bee dead. For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11992,"whosoever ordereth, and establisheth the Policy, as first founder of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11993,"a Common-wealth (be it Monarchy, Aristocracy, or Democracy) must needs"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11994,have Soveraign Power over the people all the while he is doing of it.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11995,"And that Moses had that power all his own time, is evidently affirmed in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11996,"the Scripture. First, in the text last before cited, because the people"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11997,"promised obedience, not to Aaron but to him. Secondly, (Exod. 24.1, 2.)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11998,"""And God said unto Moses, Come up unto the Lord, thou, and Aaron, Nadab"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,11999,"and Abihu, and seventy of the Elders of Israel. And Moses alone shall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12000,"come neer the Lord, but they shall not come nigh, neither shall the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12001,"people goe up with him."" By which it is plain, that Moses who was alone"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12002,"called up to God, (and not Aaron, nor the other Priests, nor the Seventy"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12003,"Elders, nor the People who were forbidden to come up) was alone he, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12004,"represented to the Israelites the Person of God; that is to say, was"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12005,their sole Soveraign under God. And though afterwards it be said (verse
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12006,"9.) ""Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12007,"Elders of Israel, and they saw the God of Israel, and there was under"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12008,"his feet, as it were a paved work of a saphire stone,"" &c. yet this was"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12009,"not till after Moses had been with God before, and had brought to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12010,the people the words which God had said to him. He onely went for the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12011,"businesse of the people; the others, as the Nobles of his retinue, were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12012,"admitted for honour to that speciall grace, which was not allowed to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12013,"the people; which was, (as in the verse after appeareth) to see God and"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12015,"drink"" (that is, did live), but did not carry any commandement from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12016,"him to the people. Again, it is every where said, ""The Lord spake unto"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12018,"of the Ceremonies of Religion, contained in the 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12019,"and 31 Chapters of Exodus, and throughout Leviticus: to Aaron seldome."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12020,"The Calfe that Aaron made, Moses threw into the fire. Lastly, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12021,"question of the Authority of Aaron, by occasion of his and Miriams"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12022,"mutiny against Moses, was (Numbers 12.) judged by God himself for Moses."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12023,"So also in the question between Moses, and the People, when Corah,"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12034,"causes of Civill Policy, but also of Religion; For Moses onely spake"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12035,"with God, and therefore onely could tell the People, what it was that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12036,God required at their hands. No man upon pain of death might be so
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12037,presumptuous as to approach the Mountain where God talked with Moses.

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12043,"may conclude, that whosoever in a Christian Common-wealth holdeth the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12044,"place of Moses, is the sole Messenger of God, and Interpreter of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12045,"his Commandements. And according hereunto, no man ought in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12046,interpretation of the Scripture to proceed further then the bounds which
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12047,are set by their severall Soveraigns. For the Scriptures since God now
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12048,"speaketh in them, are the Mount Sinai; the bounds whereof are the Laws"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12049,of them that represent Gods Person on Earth. To look upon them and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12050,"therein to behold the wondrous works of God, and learn to fear him is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12051,"allowed; but to interpret them; that is, to pry into what God saith to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12052,"him whom he appointeth to govern under him, and make themselves Judges"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12053,"whether he govern as God commandeth him, or not, is to transgresse the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12054,"bounds God hath set us, and to gaze upon God irreverently."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12055,All Spirits Were Subordinate To The Spirit Of Moses
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12056,"There was no Prophet in the time of Moses, nor pretender to the Spirit"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12057,"of God, but such as Moses had approved, and Authorized. For there were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12058,"in his time but Seventy men, that are said to Prophecy by the Spirit of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12059,"God, and these were of all Moses his election; concerning whom God saith"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12060,"to Moses (Numb. 11.16.) ""Gather to mee Seventy of the Elders of Israel,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12061,"whom thou knowest to be the Elders of the People."" To these God imparted"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12062,his Spirit; but it was not a different Spirit from that of Moses; for
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12063,"it is said (verse 25.) ""God came down in a cloud, and took of the Spirit"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12064,"that was upon Moses, and gave it to the Seventy Elders."" But as I have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12065,"shewn before (chap. 36.) by Spirit, is understood the Mind; so that the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12066,"sense of the place is no other than this, that God endued them with"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12067,"a mind conformable, and subordinate to that of Moses, that they might"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12068,"Prophecy, that is to say, speak to the people in Gods name, in such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12069,"manner, as to set forward (as Ministers of Moses, and by his authority)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12070,such doctrine as was agreeable to Moses his doctrine. For they were but
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12071,"Ministers; and when two of them Prophecyed in the Camp, it was thought"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12072,a new and unlawfull thing; and as it is in the 27. and 28. verses of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12073,"the same Chapter, they were accused of it, and Joshua advised Moses to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12074,"forbid them, as not knowing that it was by Moses his Spirit that they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12075,"Prophecyed. By which it is manifest, that no Subject ought to pretend to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12076,"Prophecy, or to the Spirit, in opposition to the doctrine established by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12077,"him, whom God hath set in the place of Moses."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12078,After Moses The Soveraignty Was In The High Priest
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12079,"Aaron being dead, and after him also Moses, the Kingdome, as being a"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12082,"for Soveraign, at the same time that he appointed Joshua for the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12083,Generall of their Army. For thus God saith expressely (Numb. 27.21.)
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12084,"concerning Joshua; ""He shall stand before Eleazar the Priest, who shall"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12087,"Israel with him:"" Therefore the Supreme Power of making War and Peace,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12088,was in the Priest. The Supreme Power of Judicature belonged also to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12089,the High Priest: For the Book of the Law was in their keeping; and the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12090,"Priests and Levites onely were the subordinate Judges in causes Civill,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12091,"as appears in Deut. 17.8, 9, 10. And for the manner of Gods worship,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12092,"there was never doubt made, but that the High Priest till the time"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12093,"of Saul, had the Supreme Authority. Therefore the Civill and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12094,Ecclesiasticall Power were both joined together in one and the same
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12095,"person, the High Priest; and ought to bee so, in whosoever governeth by"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12097,Of The Soveraign Power Between The Time Of Joshua And Of Saul
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12098,"After the death of Joshua, till the time of Saul, the time between is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12099,"noted frequently in the Book of Judges, ""that there was in those dayes"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12104,"Act, and Exercise of such power. For after the death of Joshua, &"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12105,"Eleazar, ""there arose another generation"" (Judges 2.10.) ""that knew not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12106,"the Lord, nor the works which he had done for Israel, but did evill in"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12108,"which St. Paul noteth, ""to look for a sign,"" not onely before they would"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12109,"submit themselves to the government of Moses, but also after they had"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12112,have once given it; for to that men are obliged by the law of Nature.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12113,"But if we consider not the Exercise, but the Right of governing, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12114,Soveraign power was still in the High Priest. Therefore whatsoever
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12115,"obedience was yeelded to any of the Judges, (who were men chosen by God"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12118,"Priest had to the Soveraign Power, in all matters, both of Policy and"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12133,"judge us, like all the Nations,"" they signified that they would no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12134,more bee governed by the commands that should bee laid upon them by the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12135,"Priest, in the name of God; but by one that should command them in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12136,same manner that all other nations were commanded; and consequently in
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12137,"deposing the High Priest of Royall authority, they deposed that peculiar"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12138,"Government of God. And yet God consented to it, saying to Samuel (verse"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12139,"7.) ""Hearken unto the voice of the People, in all that they shall say"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12140,"unto thee; for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected mee,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12141,"that I should not reign over them."" Having therefore rejected God, in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12142,"whose Right the Priests governed, there was no authority left to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12143,"Priests, but such as the King was pleased to allow them; which was"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12144,"more, or lesse, according as the Kings were good, or evill. And for the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12145,"Government of Civill affaires, it is manifest, it was all in the hands"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12146,"of the King. For in the same Chapter, verse 20. They say they will be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12147,"like all the Nations; that their King shall be their Judge, and goe"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12148,"before them, and fight their battells; that is, he shall have the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12149,"whole authority, both in Peace and War. In which is contained also the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12150,"ordering of Religion; for there was no other Word of God in that time,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12151,"by which to regulate Religion, but the Law of Moses, which was their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12152,"Civill Law. Besides, we read (1 Kings 2.27.) that Solomon ""thrust out"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12153,"Abiathar from being Priest before the Lord:"" He had therefore authority"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12154,"over the High Priest, as over any other Subject; which is a great"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12155,mark of Supremacy in Religion. And we read also (1 Kings 8.) that hee
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12156,dedicated the Temple; that he blessed the People; and that he himselfe
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12157,"in person made that excellent prayer, used in the Consecrations of all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12158,"Churches, and houses of Prayer; which is another great mark of Supremacy"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12159,"in Religion. Again, we read (2 Kings 22.) that when there was question"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12160,"concerning the Book of the Law found in the Temple, the same was not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12161,"decided by the High Priest, but Josiah sent both him, and others to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12162,"enquire concerning it, of Hulda, the Prophetesse; which is another mark"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12163,"of the Supremacy in Religion. Lastly, wee read (1 Chro. 26.30.) that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12164,"David made Hashabiah and his brethren, Hebronites, Officers of Israel"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12165,"among them Westward, ""in all businesse of the Lord, and in the service"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12166,"of the King."" Likewise (verse 32.) that hee made other Hebronites,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12167,"""rulers over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the halfe tribe of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12168,"Manasseh"" (these were the rest of Israel that dwelt beyond Jordan) ""for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12169,"every matter pertaining to God, and affairs of the King."" Is not this"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12170,"full Power, both Temporall and Spirituall, as they call it, that would"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12171,"divide it? To conclude; from the first institution of Gods Kingdome, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12172,"the Captivity, the Supremacy of Religion, was in the same hand with that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12173,of the Civill Soveraignty; and the Priests office after the election of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12174,"Saul, was not Magisteriall, but Ministeriall."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12175,"The Practice Of Supremacy In Religion, Was Not In The Time Of The Kings,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12176,According To The Right Thereof
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12177,"Notwithstanding the government both in Policy and Religion, were joined,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12178,"first in the High Priests, and afterwards in the Kings, so far forth as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12179,"concerned the Right; yet it appeareth by the same Holy History, that the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12180,"people understood it not; but there being amongst them a great part, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12181,"probably the greatest part, that no longer than they saw great miracles,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12182,"or (which is equivalent to a miracle) great abilities, or great felicity"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12183,"in the enterprises of their Governours, gave sufficient credit, either"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12184,"to the fame of Moses, or to the Colloquies between God and the Priests;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12185,"they took occasion as oft as their Governours displeased them, by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12186,"blaming sometimes the Policy, sometimes the Religion, to change the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12187,"Government, or revolt from their Obedience at their pleasure: And from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12188,"thence proceeded from time to time the civill troubles, divisions, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12189,"calamities of the Nation. As for example, after the death of Eleazar and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12190,"Joshua, the next generation which had not seen the wonders of God, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12191,"were left to their own weak reason, not knowing themselves obliged"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12192,"by the Covenant of a Sacerdotall Kingdome, regarded no more the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12193,"Commandement of the Priest, nor any law of Moses, but did every man that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12194,"which was right in his own eyes; and obeyed in Civill affairs, such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12195,"men, as from time to time they thought able to deliver them from the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12196,neighbour Nations that oppressed them; and consulted not with God (as
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12197,"they ought to doe,) but with such men, or women, as they guessed to bee"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12198,Prophets by their Praedictions of things to come; and thought they had
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12199,"an Idol in their Chappel, yet if they had a Levite for their Chaplain,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12200,they made account they worshipped the God of Israel.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12201,"And afterwards when they demanded a King, after the manner of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12202,nations; yet it was not with a design to depart from the worship of God
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12203,"their King; but despairing of the justice of the sons of Samuel, they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12204,would have a King to judg them in Civill actions; but not that they
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12205,would allow their King to change the Religion which they thought was
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12206,recommended to them by Moses. So that they alwaies kept in store a
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12207,"pretext, either of Justice, or Religion, to discharge themselves of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12208,"their obedience, whensoever they had hope to prevaile. Samuel was"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12209,"displeased with the people, for that they desired a King, (for God was"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12210,"their King already, and Samuel had but an authority under him); yet did"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12211,"Samuel, when Saul observed not his counsell, in destroying Agag as God"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12212,"had commanded, anoint another King, namely David, to take the succession"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12213,from his heirs. Rehoboam was no Idolater; but when the people thought
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12214,him an Oppressor; that Civil pretence carried from him ten Tribes to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12215,Jeroboam an Idolater. And generally through the whole History of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12216,"Kings, as well of Judah, as of Israel, there were Prophets that alwaies"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12217,"controlled the Kings, for transgressing the Religion; and sometimes also"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12218,for Errours of State; (2 Chro. 19. 2.) as Jehosaphat was reproved by
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12219,"the Prophet Jehu, for aiding the King of Israel against the Syrians;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12220,"and Hezekiah, by Isaiah, for shewing his treasures to the Ambassadors of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12221,"Babylon. By all which it appeareth, that though the power both of State"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12222,and Religion were in the Kings; yet none of them were uncontrolled
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12223,"in the use of it, but such as were gracious for their own naturall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12224,"abilities, or felicities. So that from the practise of those times,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12225,"there can no argument be drawn, that the right of Supremacy in Religion"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12226,"was not in the Kings, unlesse we place it in the Prophets; and conclude,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12227,"that because Hezekiah praying to the Lord before the Cherubins, was not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12228,"answered from thence, nor then, but afterwards by the Prophet Isaiah,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12229,therefore Isaiah was supreme Head of the Church; or because Josiah
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12230,"consulted Hulda the Prophetesse, concerning the Book of the Law, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12231,"therefore neither he, nor the High Priest, but Hulda the Prophetesse had"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12232,the Supreme authority in matter of Religion; which I thinke is not the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12233,opinion of any Doctor.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12234,After The Captivity The Jews Had No Setled Common-wealth
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12235,"During the Captivity, the Jews had no Common-wealth at all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12236,"And after their return, though they renewed their Covenant with God, yet"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12237,"there was no promise made of obedience, neither to Esdras, nor to any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12238,other; And presently after they became subjects to the Greeks (from
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12239,"whose Customes, and Daemonology, and from the doctrine of the Cabalists,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12240,their Religion became much corrupted): In such sort as nothing can be
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12241,"gathered from their confusion, both in State and Religion, concerning"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12242,the Supremacy in either. And therefore so far forth as concerneth the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12243,"Old Testament, we may conclude, that whosoever had the Soveraignty"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12244,"of the Common-wealth amongst the Jews, the same had also the Supreme"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12245,Authority in matter of Gods externall worship; and represented Gods
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12246,Person; that is the person of God the Father; though he were not called
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12247,"by the name of Father, till such time as he sent into the world his Son"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12248,"Jesus Christ, to redeem mankind from their sins, and bring them into his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12249,"Everlasting Kingdome, to be saved for evermore. Of which we are to speak"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,40,12250,in the Chapter following.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12251,CHAPTER XLI. OF THE OFFICE OF OUR BLESSED SAVIOUR
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12252,Three Parts Of The Office Of Christ
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12253,We find in Holy Scripture three parts of the Office of the Messiah: the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12254,"first of a Redeemer, or Saviour: The second of a Pastor, Counsellour,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12255,"or Teacher, that is, of a Prophet sent from God, to convert such as God"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12256,"hath elected to Salvation; The third of a King, and Eternall King, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12257,"under his Father, as Moses and the High Priests were in their severall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12258,times. And to these three parts are corespondent three times. For our
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12259,"Redemption he wrought at his first coming, by the Sacrifice, wherein"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12260,he offered up himself for our sinnes upon the Crosse: our conversion
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12261,he wrought partly then in his own Person; and partly worketh now by his
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12262,Ministers; and will continue to work till his coming again. And after
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12263,"his coming again, shall begin that his glorious Reign over his elect,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12264,which is to last eternally.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12265,His Office As A Redeemer
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12266,"To the Office of a Redeemer, that is, of one that payeth the Ransome of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12267,"Sin, (which Ransome is Death,) it appertaineth, that he was Sacrificed,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12268,"and thereby bare upon his own head, and carryed away from us our"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12269,"iniquities, in such sort as God had required. Not that the death of one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12270,"man, though without sinne, can satisfie for the offences of all men,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12271,"in the rigour of Justice, but in the Mercy of God, that ordained such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12272,"Sacrifices for sin, as he was pleased in his mercy to accept. In the old"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12273,"Law (as we may read, Leviticus the 16.) the Lord required, that there"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12274,"should every year once, bee made an Atonement for the Sins of all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12275,"Israel, both Priests, and others; for the doing whereof, Aaron alone was"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12276,to sacrifice for himself and the Priests a young Bullock; and for the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12277,"rest of the people, he was to receive from them two young Goates, of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12278,"which he was to Sacrifice one; but as for the other, which was the Scape"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12279,"Goat, he was to lay his hands on the head thereof, and by a confession"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12280,"of the iniquities of the people, to lay them all on that head, and then"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12281,"by some opportune man, to cause the Goat to be led into the wildernesse,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12282,"and there to Escape, and carry away with him the iniquities of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12283,people. As the Sacrifice of the one Goat was a sufficient (because an
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12284,acceptable) price for the Ransome of all Israel; so the death of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12285,"Messiah, is a sufficient price, for the Sins of all mankind, because"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12286,there was no more required. Our Saviour Christs sufferings seem to be
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12287,"here figured, as cleerly, as in the oblation of Isaac, or in any other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12288,"type of him in the Old Testament: He was both the sacrificed Goat, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12289,"the Scape Goat; ""Hee was oppressed, and he was afflicted (Isa. 53.7.);"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12290,"he opened not his mouth; he brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12291,"sheep is dumbe before the shearer, so opened he not his mouth:"" Here he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12292,"is the Sacrificed Goat. ""He hath born our Griefs, (ver.4.) and carried"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12293,"our sorrows;"" And again, (ver. 6.) ""the Lord hath laid upon him the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12294,"iniquities of us all:"" And so he is the Scape Goat. ""He was cut off from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12295,"the land of the living (ver. 8.) for the transgression of my People:"""
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12296,"There again he is the Sacrificed Goat. And again (ver. 11.) ""he shall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12297,"bear their sins:"" Hee is the Scape Goat. Thus is the Lamb of God"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12298,"equivalent to both those Goates; sacrificed, in that he dyed; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12299,"escaping, in his Resurrection; being raised opportunely by his Father,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12300,and removed from the habitation of men in his Ascension.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12301,Christs Kingdome Not Of This World
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12302,"For as much therefore, as he that Redeemeth, hath no title to the Thing"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12303,"Redeemed, before the Redemption, and Ransome paid; and this Ransome was"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12304,"the Death of the Redeemer; it is manifest, that our Saviour (as man) was"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12305,"not King of those that he Redeemed, before hee suffered death; that is,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12306,"during that time hee conversed bodily on the Earth. I say, he was not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12307,"then King in present, by vertue of the Pact, which the faithfull make"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12308,"with him in Baptisme; Neverthelesse, by the renewing of their Pact with"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12309,"God in Baptisme, they were obliged to obey him for King, (under his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12310,Father) whensoever he should be pleased to take the Kingdome upon him.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12311,"According whereunto, our Saviour himself expressely saith, (John 18.36.)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12312,"""My Kingdome is not of this world."" Now seeing the Scripture maketh"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12313,"mention but of two worlds; this that is now, and shall remain to the day"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12314,"of Judgment, (which is therefore also called, The Last Day;) and that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12315,"which shall bee a new Heaven, and a new Earth; the Kingdome of Christ"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12316,is not to begin till the general Resurrection. And that is it which our
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12317,"Saviour saith, (Mat. 16.27.) ""The Son of man shall come in the glory"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12318,"of his Father, with his Angels; and then he shall reward every man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12319,"according to his works."" To reward every man according to his works, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12320,to execute the Office of a King; and this is not to be till he come in
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12321,"the glory of his Father, with his Angells. When our Saviour saith,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12322,"(Mat. 23.2.) ""The Scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses seat; All therefore"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12323,"whatsoever they bid you doe, that observe and doe;"" hee declareth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12324,"plainly, that hee ascribeth Kingly Power, for that time, not to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12325,"himselfe, but to them. And so hee hath also, where he saith, (Luke"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12326,"12.14.) ""Who made mee a Judge, or Divider over you?"" And (John 12.47.)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12327,"""I came not to judge the world, but to save the world."" And yet our"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12328,"Saviour came into this world that hee might bee a King, and a Judge in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12329,"the world to come: For hee was the Messiah, that is, the Christ, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12330,"is, the Anointed Priest, and the Soveraign Prophet of God; that is to"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12334,"judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son."" And this is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12335,"not repugnant to that other place, ""I came not to judge the world:"" for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12336,"this is spoken of the world present, the other of the world to come; as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12337,"also where it is said, that at the second coming of Christ, (Mat. 19."

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12432,"who shall sit on twelve thrones, and judge the twelve tribes of Israel;"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12449,"into the land of Promise; so also the Jews, before the coming of our"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12450,"Saviour, had a rite of Baptizing, that is, of washing with water all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12451,"those that being Gentiles, embraced the God of Israel. This rite St."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12452,John the Baptist used in the reception of all them that gave their names
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12453,"to the Christ, whom hee preached to bee already come into the world; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12454,our Saviour instituted the same for a Sacrament to be taken by all that
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12455,"beleeved in him. From what cause the rite of Baptisme first proceeded,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12456,is not expressed formally in the Scripture; but it may be probably
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12457,"thought to be an imitation of the law of Moses, concerning Leprousie;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12458,wherein the Leprous man was commanded to be kept out of the campe of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12459,Israel for a certain time; after which time being judged by the Priest
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12460,"to be clean, hee was admitted into the campe after a solemne Washing."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12461,And this may therefore bee a type of the Washing in Baptisme; wherein
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12462,"such men as are cleansed of the Leprousie of Sin by Faith, are received"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12463,into the Church with the solemnity of Baptisme. There is another
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12464,"conjecture drawn from the Ceremonies of the Gentiles, in a certain case"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12465,"that rarely happens; and that is, when a man that was thought dead,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12466,"chanced to recover, other men made scruple to converse with him, as they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12467,"would doe to converse with a Ghost, unlesse hee were received again into"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12469,"the uncleannesse of their nativity, which was a kind of new birth. This"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12470,"ceremony of the Greeks, in the time that Judaea was under the Dominion"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12471,"of Alexander, and the Greeks his successors, may probably enough have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12472,crept into the Religion of the Jews. But seeing it is not likely our
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12473,"Saviour would countenance a Heathen rite, it is most likely it proceeded"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12474,from the Legall Ceremony of Washing after Leprosie. And for the other
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12475,"Sacraments, of eating the Paschall Lambe, it is manifestly imitated in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12476,"the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; in which the Breaking of the Bread,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12477,"and the pouring out of the Wine, do keep in memory our deliverance from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12478,"the Misery of Sin, by Christs Passion, as the eating of the Paschall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12479,"Lambe, kept in memory the deliverance of the Jewes out of the Bondage of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12480,"Egypt. Seeing therefore the authority of Moses was but subordinate, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12481,"hee but a Lieutenant to God; it followeth, that Christ, whose authority,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12482,"as man, was to bee like that of Moses, was no more but subordinate to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,41,12483,"the authority of his Father. The same is more expressely signified, by"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12506,"And for the time between, it is manifest, that the Power"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12507,"Ecclesiasticall, was in the Apostles; and after them in such as were by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12508,"them ordained to Preach the Gospell, and to convert men to Christianity,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12509,and to direct them that were converted in the way of Salvation; and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12510,"after these the Power was delivered again to others by these ordained,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12511,and this was done by Imposition of hands upon such as were ordained; by

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12516,"the Holy Ghost by that ceremony of Imposition of hands, was an imitation"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12517,of that which Moses did. For Moses used the same ceremony to his
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12518,"Minister Joshua, as wee read Deuteronomy 34. ver. 9. ""And Joshua the son"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12519,of Nun was full of the Spirit of Wisdome; for Moses had laid his

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12521,"Ascension, gave his Spirit to the Apostles; first, by ""Breathing on"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12522,"them, and saying,"" (John 20.22.) ""Receive yee the Holy Spirit;"" and after"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12523,"his Ascension (Acts 2.2, 3.) by sending down upon them, a ""mighty wind,"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12526,"the same Spirit by Imposition of hands, as Moses did to Joshua. So that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12527,"it is manifest hereby, in whom the Power Ecclesiasticall continually"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12540,"Personated) thrice, may properly enough be said to be three Persons;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12541,"though neither the word Person, nor Trinity be ascribed to him in the"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12552,"11.) that they bear witnesse, that ""God hath given us eternall life"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12553,"in his Son."" Again, if it should be asked, wherein that testimony"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12554,"appeareth, the Answer is easie; for he hath testified the same by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12555,"miracles he wrought, first by Moses; secondly, by his Son himself; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12556,"lastly by his Apostles, that had received the Holy Spirit; all which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12557,"in their times Represented the Person of God; and either prophecyed, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12558,"preached Jesus Christ. And as for the Apostles, it was the character"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12559,"of the Apostleship, in the twelve first and great Apostles, to bear"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12560,Witnesse of his Resurrection; as appeareth expressely (Acts 1. ver.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12561,"21,22.) where St Peter, when a new Apostle was to be chosen in the place"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12562,"of Judas Iscariot, useth these words, ""Of these men which have companied"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12563,"with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out amongst us,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12564,"beginning at the Baptisme of John, unto that same day that hee was"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12565,"taken up from us, must one bee ordained to be a Witnesse with us of his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12566,"Resurrection:"" which words interpret the Bearing of Witnesse, mentioned"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12567,by St. John. There is in the same place mentioned another Trinity of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12568,"Witnesses in Earth. For (ver. 8.) he saith, ""there are three that bear"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12569,"Witnesse in Earth, the Spirit, and the Water, and the Bloud; and these"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12570,"three agree in one:"" that is to say, the graces of Gods Spirit, and the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12571,"two Sacraments, Baptisme, and the Lords Supper, which all agree in one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12572,"Testimony, to assure the consciences of beleevers, of eternall life; of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12573,"which Testimony he saith (verse 10.) ""He that beleeveth on the Son of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12574,"man hath the Witnesse in himselfe."" In this Trinity on Earth the Unity"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12575,"is not of the thing; for the Spirit, the Water, and the Bloud, are not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12576,"the same substance, though they give the same testimony: But in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12577,"Trinity of Heaven, the Persons are the persons of one and the same God,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12578,"though Represented in three different times and occasions. To conclude,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12579,"the doctrine of the Trinity, as far as can be gathered directly from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12580,"the Scripture, is in substance this; that God who is alwaies One and the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12581,"same, was the Person Represented by Moses; the Person Represented by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12582,his Son Incarnate; and the Person Represented by the Apostles. As
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12583,"Represented by the Apostles, the Holy Spirit by which they spake, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12584,"God; As Represented by his Son (that was God and Man), the Son is that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12585,"God; As represented by Moses, and the High Priests, the Father, that is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12586,"to say, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, is that God: From whence"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12587,"we may gather the reason why those names Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12588,"the signification of the Godhead, are never used in the Old Testament:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12589,"For they are Persons, that is, they have their names from Representing;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12590,"which could not be, till divers men had Represented Gods Person in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12591,"ruling, or in directing under him."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12592,Thus wee see how the Power Ecclesiasticall was left by our Saviour
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12593,to the Apostles; and how they were (to the end they might the better

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12769,"Also he that is not sent to preach this fundamentall article, but taketh"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12775,the reward he expecteth from those that never set him on work. None

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12778,"none, but such as are sent to the conversion of Infidels. For no man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12779,"is a Witnesse to him that already beleeveth, and therefore needs no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12780,"Witnesse; but to them that deny, or doubt, or have not heard it. Christ"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12781,"sent his Apostles, and his Seventy Disciples, with authority to preach;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12782,"he sent not all that beleeved: And he sent them to unbeleevers; ""I send"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12784,Argument From The Points Of Their Commission
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12785,"Lastly the points of their Commission, as they are expressely set down"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12786,"in the Gospel, contain none of them any authority over the Congregation."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12787,To Preach
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12788,"We have first (Mat. 10.) that the twelve Apostles were sent ""to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12789,"lost sheep of the house of Israel,"" and commanded to Preach, ""that the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12790,"Kingdome of God was at hand."" Now Preaching in the originall, is that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12791,"act, which a Crier, Herald, or other Officer useth to doe publiquely in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12792,Proclaiming of a King. But a Crier hath not right to Command any man.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12793,"And (Luke 10.2.) the seventy Disciples are sent out, ""as Labourers,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12794,"not as Lords of the Harvest;"" and are bidden (verse 9.) to say, ""The"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12795,"Kingdome of God is come nigh unto you;"" and by Kingdome here is meant,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12796,"not the Kingdome of Grace, but the Kingdome of Glory; for they are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12797,bidden to denounce it (ver. 11.) to those Cities which shall not receive
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12798,"them, as a threatning, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12799,"Sodome, than for such a City. And (Mat. 20.28.) our Saviour telleth his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12800,"Disciples, that sought Priority of place, their Office was to minister,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12801,"even as the Son of man came, not to be ministred unto, but to minister."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12802,"Preachers therefore have not Magisteriall, but Ministeriall power: ""Bee"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12803,"not called Masters, (saith our Saviour, Mat. 23.10) for one is your"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12804,"Master, even Christ."""
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12805,And Teach

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12807,"Mat. 28.19. or as in St. Mark 16.15 ""Goe into all the world, and Preach"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12808,"the Gospel to every creature."" Teaching therefore, and Preaching is the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12809,"same thing. For they that Proclaim the comming of a King, must withall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12810,"make known by what right he commeth, if they mean men shall submit"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12811,"themselves unto him: As St. Paul did to the Jews of Thessalonica,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12812,"when ""three Sabbath days he reasoned with them out of the Scriptures,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12813,"opening, and alledging that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12814,"again from the dead, and that this Jesus is Christ."" But to teach out"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12815,"of the Old Testament that Jesus was Christ, (that is to say, King,)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12816,"and risen from the dead, is not to say, that men are bound after they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12817,"beleeve it, to obey those that tell them so, against the laws, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12818,"commands of their Soveraigns; but that they shall doe wisely, to expect"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12819,"the coming of Christ hereafter, in Patience, and Faith, with Obedience"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12820,to their present Magistrates.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12821,To Baptize;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12822,"Another point of their Commission, is to Baptize, ""in the name of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12823,"the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost."" What is Baptisme?"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12824,Dipping into water. But what is it to Dip a man into the water in the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12825,name of any thing? The meaning of these words of Baptisme is this. He
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12826,"that is Baptized, is Dipped or Washed, as a sign of becomming a new man,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12827,"and a loyall subject to that God, whose Person was represented in old"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12828,"time by Moses, and the High Priests, when he reigned over the Jews; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12829,"to Jesus Christ, his Sonne, God, and Man, that hath redeemed us, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12830,shall in his humane nature Represent his Fathers Person in his eternall

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12833,"left for guides to bring us into that Kingdome, to be the onely, and"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12835,Authority of Earthly Soveraigns being not to be put down till the day of

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12837,"24. where he saith, ""As in Adam all die, so in Christ all shall be"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12841,"when he shall have put down all Rule, and all Authority and Power"")"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12842,"it is manifest, that we do not in Baptisme constitute over us another"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12843,"authority, by which our externall actions are to be governed in this"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12844,life; but promise to take the doctrine of the Apostles for our direction

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12847,"The Power of Remission, And Retention Of Sinnes, called also the Power"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12848,"of Loosing, and Binding, and sometimes the Keyes Of The Kingdome Of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12849,"Heaven, is a consequence of the Authority to Baptize, or refuse to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12850,"Baptize. For Baptisme is the Sacrament of Allegeance, of them that are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12851,"to be received into the Kingdome of God; that is to say, into Eternall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12852,"life; that is to say, to Remission of Sin: For as Eternall life was lost"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12853,"by the Committing, so it is recovered by the Remitting of mens Sins. The"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12854,"end of Baptisme is Remission of Sins: and therefore St. Peter, when they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12855,"that were converted by his Sermon on the day of Pentecost, asked what"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12856,"they were to doe, advised them to ""repent, and be Baptized in the name"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12857,"of Jesus, for the Remission of Sins."" And therefore seeing to Baptize"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12858,is to declare the Reception of men into Gods Kingdome; and to refuse to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12859,"Baptize is to declare their Exclusion; it followeth, that the Power"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12860,"to declare them Cast out, or Retained in it, was given to the same"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12861,"Apostles, and their Substitutes, and Successors. And therefore after our"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12862,"Saviour had breathed upon them, saying, (John 20.22.) ""Receive the Holy"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12863,"Ghost,"" hee addeth in the next verse, ""Whose soever Sins ye Remit,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12864,"they are Remitted unto them; and whose soever Sins ye Retain, they are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12865,"Retained."" By which words, is not granted an Authority to Forgive, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12866,"Retain Sins, simply and absolutely, as God Forgiveth or Retaineth them,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12867,"who knoweth the Heart of man, and truth of his Penitence and Conversion;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12868,"but conditionally, to the Penitent: And this Forgivenesse, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12869,"Absolution, in case the absolved have but a feigned Repentance, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12870,"thereby without other act, or sentence of the Absolvent, made void,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12871,"and hath no effect at all to Salvation, but on the contrary, to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12872,"Aggravation of his Sin. Therefore the Apostles, and their Successors,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12873,"are to follow but the outward marks of Repentance; which appearing, they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12874,"have no Authority to deny Absolution; and if they appeare not, they have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12875,no authority to Absolve. The same also is to be observed in Baptisme:
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12876,"for to a converted Jew, or Gentile, the Apostles had not the Power to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12877,deny Baptisme; nor to grant it to the Un-penitent. But seeing no man is
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12878,"able to discern the truth of another mans Repentance, further than by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12879,"externall marks, taken from his words, and actions, which are subject to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12880,"hypocrisie; another question will arise, Who it is that is constituted"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12881,Judge of those marks. And this question is decided by our Saviour
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12882,"himself; (Mat. 18. 15, 16, 17.) ""If thy Brother (saith he) shall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12883,"trespasse against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee, and him"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12885,"will not hear thee, then take with thee one, or two more. And if he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12886,"shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the Church, let him be unto"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12887,"thee as an Heathen man, and a Publican."" By which it is manifest, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12888,"the Judgment concerning the truth of Repentance, belonged not to any one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12889,"Man, but to the Church, that is, to the Assembly of the Faithfull, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12890,to them that have authority to bee their Representant. But besides the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12891,"Judgment, there is necessary also the pronouncing of Sentence: And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12892,"this belonged alwaies to the Apostle, or some Pastor of the Church,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12893,"as Prolocutor; and of this our Saviour speaketh in the 18 verse,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12894,"""Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12895,"whatsoever ye shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven."" And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12896,"comformable hereunto was the practise of St. Paul (1 Cor. 5.3, 4, & 5.)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12897,"where he saith, ""For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit,"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12904,(for St. Paul was absent;) and by consequence to condemn him. But in
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12905,"the same chapter (ver. 11, 12.) the Judgment in such a case is more"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12911,"pronounced by the Apostle, or Pastor; but the Judgment concerning the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12912,"merit of the cause, was in the Church; that is to say, (as the times"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12913,"were before the conversion of Kings, and men that had Soveraign"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12971,that were Excommunicated by the Church. And thence it is that St. Paul
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12972,"calleth Excommunication, a delivery of the Excommunicate person to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12973,"Satan. For without the Kingdom of Christ, all other Kingdomes after"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12976,"to say, in an estate wherein their sins were not Forgiven. Whereby wee"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12977,"may understand, that Excommunication in the time that Christian Religion"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12978,"was not authorized by the Civill Power, was used onely for a correction"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12979,"of manners, not of errours in opinion: for it is a punishment, whereof"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12980,"none could be sensible but such as beleeved, and expected the coming"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12981,"again of our Saviour to judge the world; and they who so beleeved,"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12984,There Lyeth Excommunication for Injustice; as (Mat. 18.) If thy Brother

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,12999,"the first, and second admonition, to Reject. But to Reject (in this"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13000,place) is not to Excommunicate the Man; But to Give Over Admonishing

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13002,be convinced onely by himselfe. The same Apostle saith (2 Tim. 2.23.)
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13003,"""Foolish and unlearned questions avoid;"" The word Avoid in this place,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13004,"and Reject in the former, is the same in the Originall, paraitou: but"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13025,"That a man be liable to Excommunication, there be many conditions"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13026,"requisite; as First, that he be a member of some Commonalty, that is to"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13028,"Church, that hath power to judge of the cause for which hee is to"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13031,"power to give Sentence. From hence it followeth, that one Church cannot"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13032,be Excommunicated by another: For either they have equall power
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13033,"to Excommunicate each other, in which case Excommunication is not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13034,"Discipline, nor an act of Authority, but Schisme, and Dissolution of"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13036,"have but one voice, and then they be but one Church; and the part"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13037,"Excommunicated, is no more a Church, but a dissolute number of"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13039,"And because the sentence of Excommunication, importeth an advice, not to"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13041,"a Soveraign Prince, or Assembly bee Excommunicate, the sentence is of no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13042,effect. For all Subjects are bound to be in the company and presence of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13043,their own Soveraign (when he requireth it) by the law of Nature; nor

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13056,"of his own Soveraign, whether Christian, or Heathen, of any effect. For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13057,"if he beleeve that ""Jesus is the Christ, he hath the Spirit of God"" (1"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13058,"Joh. 4.1.) ""and God dwelleth in him, and he in God,"" (1 Joh. 4.15.) But"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13059,hee that hath the Spirit of God; hee that dwelleth in God; hee in
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13060,"whom God dwelleth, can receive no harm by the Excommunication of men."

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13183,"There be two senses, wherein a Writing may be said to be Canonicall;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13184,"for Canon, signifieth a Rule; and a Rule is a Precept, by which a man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13185,"is guided, and directed in any action whatsoever. Such Precepts, though"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13186,"given by a Teacher to his Disciple, or a Counsellor to his friend,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13187,"without power to Compell him to observe them, are neverthelesse Canons;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13188,"because they are Rules: But when they are given by one, whom he that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13189,"receiveth them is bound to obey, then are those Canons, not onely Rules,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13190,"but Laws: The question therefore here, is of the Power to make the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13191,Scriptures (which are the Rules of Christian Faith) Laws.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13192,Of The Ten Commandements
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13193,"That part of the Scripture, which was first Law, was the Ten"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13194,"Commandements, written in two Tables of Stone, and delivered by God"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13195,himselfe to Moses; and by Moses made known to the people. Before that
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13196,"time there was no written Law of God, who as yet having not chosen any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13197,"people to bee his peculiar Kingdome, had given no Law to men, but the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13198,"Law of Nature, that is to say, the Precepts of Naturall Reason, written"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13199,"in every mans own heart. Of these two Tables, the first containeth the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13200,"law of Soveraignty; 1. That they should not obey, nor honour the Gods of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13201,"other Nations, in these words, ""Non habebis Deos alienos coram me,"" that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13202,"is, ""Thou shalt not have for Gods, the Gods that other Nations worship;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13203,"but onely me:"" whereby they were forbidden to obey, or honor, as their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13204,"King and Governour, any other God, than him that spake unto them then by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13205,"Moses, and afterwards by the High Priest. 2. That they ""should not make"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13206,"any Image to represent him;"" that is to say, they were not to choose to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13207,"themselves, neither in heaven, nor in earth, any Representative of their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13208,"own fancying, but obey Moses and Aaron, whom he had appointed to that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13209,"office. 3. That ""they should not take the Name of God in vain;"" that is,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13210,"they should not speak rashly of their King, nor dispute his Right,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13211,"nor the commissions of Moses and Aaron, his Lieutenants. 4. That ""they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13212,"should every Seventh day abstain from their ordinary labour,"" and employ"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13213,that time in doing him Publique Honor. The second Table containeth the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13214,"Duty of one man towards another, as ""To honor Parents; Not to kill;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13215,Not to Commit Adultery; Not to steale; Not to corrupt Judgment by false
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13216,"witnesse;"" and finally, ""Not so much as to designe in their heart the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13217,"doing of any injury one to another."" The question now is, Who it was"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13218,that gave to these written Tables the obligatory force of Lawes. There
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13219,is no doubt but that they were made Laws by God himselfe: But because a
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13220,"Law obliges not, nor is Law to any, but to them that acknowledge it to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13221,"be the act of the Soveraign, how could the people of Israel that were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13222,"forbidden to approach the Mountain to hear what God said to Moses, be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13223,obliged to obedience to all those laws which Moses propounded to them?
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13224,"Some of them were indeed the Laws of Nature, as all the Second Table;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13225,and therefore to be acknowledged for Gods Laws; not to the Israelites
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13226,"alone, but to all people: But of those that were peculiar to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13227,"Israelites, as those of the first Table, the question remains; saving"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13228,"that they had obliged themselves, presently after the propounding of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13229,"them, to obey Moses, in these words (Exod. 20.19.) ""Speak them thou to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13230,"us, and we will hear thee; but let not God speak to us, lest we die."" It"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13231,"was therefore onely Moses then, and after him the High Priest, whom (by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13232,"Moses) God declared should administer this his peculiar Kingdome, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13233,"had on Earth, the power to make this short Scripture of the Decalogue"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13234,"to bee Law in the Common-wealth of Israel. But Moses, and Aaron, and the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13235,"succeeding High Priests were the Civill Soveraigns. Therefore hitherto,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13236,"the Canonizing, or making of the Scripture Law, belonged to the Civill"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13237,Soveraigne.

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13241,"and of the Sentences, or Judgments they should pronounce, in Pleas"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13242,"between man and man; and the Leviticall Law, that is to say, the rule"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13243,that God prescribed touching the Rites and Ceremonies of the Priests and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13244,"Levites, were all delivered to them by Moses onely; and therefore also"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13245,"became Lawes, by vertue of the same promise of obedience to Moses."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13246,"Whether these laws were then written, or not written, but dictated to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13247,the People by Moses (after his forty dayes being with God in the Mount)
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13248,"by word of mouth, is not expressed in the Text; but they were all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13249,"positive Laws, and equivalent to holy Scripture, and made Canonicall by"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13252,After the Israelites were come into the Plains of Moab over against

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13269,and by his authority received for the Law of God. But both Moses at the

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13271,Civill Soveraignty. Hitherto therefore the Power of making Scripture

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13288,"when it was found againe, they had no written Word of God, but ruled"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13291,"The Old Testament, When Made Canonicall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13292,"From whence we may inferre, that the Scriptures of the Old Testament,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13293,"which we have at this day, were not Canonicall, nor a Law unto the Jews,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13294,till the renovation of their Covenant with God at their return from the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13295,"Captivity, and restauration of their Common-wealth under Esdras. But"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13296,"from that time forward they were accounted the Law of the Jews, and for"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13298,"Library of Ptolemy at Alexandria, and approved for the Word of God. Now"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13299,"seeing Esdras was the High Priest, and the High Priest was their Civill"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13300,"Soveraigne, it is manifest, that the Scriptures were never made Laws,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13301,but by the Soveraign Civill Power.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13302,The New Testament Began To Be Canonicall Under Christian Soveraigns By
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13303,the Writings of the Fathers that lived in the time before that Christian
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13304,"Religion was received, and authorised by Constantine the Emperour, we"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13305,"may find, that the Books wee now have of the New Testament, were held by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13306,"the Christians of that time (except a few, in respect of whose paucity"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13307,"the rest were called the Catholique Church, and others Haeretiques) for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13308,"the dictates of the Holy Ghost; and consequently for the Canon, or Rule"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13309,of Faith: such was the reverence and opinion they had of their Teachers;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13310,as generally the reverence that the Disciples bear to their first
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13311,"Masters, in all manner of doctrine they receive from them, is not small."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13312,"Therefore there is no doubt, but when S. Paul wrote to the Churches he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13313,"had converted; or any other Apostle, or Disciple of Christ, to those"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13314,"which had then embraced Christ, they received those their Writings for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13315,"the true Christian Doctrine. But in that time, when not the Power and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13316,"Authority of the Teacher, but the Faith of the Hearer caused them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13317,"to receive it, it was not the Apostles that made their own Writings"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13318,"Canonicall, but every Convert made them so to himself."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13319,"But the question here, is not what any Christian made a Law, or Canon"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13320,"to himself, (which he might again reject, by the same right he received"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13321,"it;) but what was so made a Canon to them, as without injustice they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13322,could not doe any thing contrary thereunto. That the New Testament
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13323,"should in this sense be Canonicall, that is to say, a Law in any place"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13324,"where the Law of the Common-wealth had not made it so, is contrary to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13325,"the nature of a Law. For a Law, (as hath been already shewn) is the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13326,"Commandement of that Man, or Assembly, to whom we have given Soveraign"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13327,"Authority, to make such Rules for the direction of our actions, as hee"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13328,"shall think fit; and to punish us, when we doe any thing contrary to the"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13330,"which the Soveraign Ruler hath not prescribed, they are but Counsell,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13331,"and Advice; which, whether good, or bad, hee that is counselled, may"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13332,"without injustice refuse to observe, and when contrary to the Laws"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13333,"already established, without injustice cannot observe, how good soever"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13334,"he conceiveth it to be. I say, he cannot in this case observe the same"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13335,"in his actions, nor in his discourse with other men; though he may"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13336,"without blame beleeve the his private Teachers, and wish he had the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13337,liberty to practise their advice; and that it were publiquely received
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13338,"for Law. For internall faith is in its own nature invisible, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13339,"consequently exempted from all humane jurisdiction; whereas the words,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13340,"and actions that proceed from it, as breaches of our Civil obedience,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13341,are injustice both before God and Man. Seeing then our Saviour hath
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13342,"denyed his Kingdome to be in this world, seeing he hath said, he came"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13343,"not to judge, but to save the world, he hath not subjected us to other"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13351,"Seeing then our Saviour, and his Apostles, left not new Laws to oblige"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13509,"chose him for a vessell to bear his name before the Gentiles, and Kings,"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13516,What Offices In The Church Are Magisteriall
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13517,"Bishop, a word formed in our language, out of the Greek Episcopus,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13518,"signifieth an overseer, or Superintendent of any businesse, and"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13522,"or Guide of People, whether he ruled by Laws, or Doctrine. And so"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13523,"the Apostles were the first Christian Bishops, instituted by Christ"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13524,himselfe: in which sense the Apostleship of Judas is called (Acts 1.20.)
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13525,"his Bishoprick. And afterwards, when there were constituted Elders in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13526,"the Christian Churches, with charge to guide Christs flock by their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13527,"doctrine, and advice; these Elders were also called Bishops. Timothy was"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13529,well as of Age;) yet he was also a Bishop. And Bishops were then content
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13530,"with the Title of Elders. Nay S. John himselfe, the Apostle beloved of"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13532,"the Elect Lady."" By which it is evident, that Bishop, Pastor, Elder,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13533,"Doctor, that is to say, Teacher, were but so many divers names of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13534,the same Office in the time of the Apostles. For there was then no
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13535,"government by Coercion, but only by Doctrine, and Perswading. The"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13536,"Kingdome of God was yet to come, in a new world; so that there could"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13537,"be no authority to compell in any Church, till the Common-wealth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13538,had embraced the Christian Faith; and consequently no diversity of

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13540,"Besides these Magisteriall employments in the Church, namely Apostles,"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13545,"Gifts, by which severall men were profitable to the Church: as"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13551,interpreting the Old Testament; and sometimes by declaring their

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13564,"converted men to the Christian Faith, immediately after he and Barnabas"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13565,"had received their Apostleship. We read (Acts 14.23.) that ""they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13566,"ordained Elders in every Church;"" which at first sight may be taken for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13567,"an Argument, that they themselves chose, and gave them their authority:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13568,"But if we consider the Originall text, it will be manifest, that they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13569,"were authorized, and chosen by the Assembly of the Christians of each"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13570,"City. For the words there are, ""cheirotonesantes autoispresbuterous kat"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13572,"up of Hands in every Congregation."" Now it is well enough known, that in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13573,"all those Cities, the manner of choosing Magistrates, and Officers,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13574,was by plurality of suffrages; and (because the ordinary way of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13575,"distinguishing the Affirmative Votes from the Negatives, was by Holding"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13576,"up of Hands) to ordain an Officer in any of the Cities, was no more"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13577,"but to bring the people together, to elect them by plurality of Votes,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13578,"whether it were by plurality of elevated hands, or by plurality of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13579,"voices, or plurality of balls, or beans, or small stones, of which every"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13580,"man cast in one, into a vessell marked for the Affirmative, or Negative;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13581,for divers Cities had divers customes in that point. It was therefore
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13582,the Assembly that elected their own Elders: the Apostles were onely
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13583,"Presidents of the Assembly to call them together for such Election, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13584,"to pronounce them Elected, and to give them the benediction, which now"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13585,is called Consecration. And for this cause they that were Presidents
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13586,"of the Assemblies, as (in the absence of the Apostles) the Elders were,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13587,"were called proestotes, and in Latin Antistities; which words signifie"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13588,"the Principall Person of the Assembly, whose office was to number the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13589,"Votes, and to declare thereby who was chosen; and where the Votes were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13590,"equall, to decide the matter in question, by adding his own; which is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13591,the Office of a President in Councell. And (because all the Churches

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13607,"The same is also confirmed by the continuall practise even to this day,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13608,"in the Election of the Bishops of Rome. For if the Bishop of any place,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13609,"had the right of choosing another, to the succession of the Pastorall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13610,"Office, in any City, at such time as he went from thence, to plant the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13611,"same in another place; much more had he had the Right, to appoint his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13612,"successour in that place, in which he last resided and dyed: And we find"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13613,"not, that ever any Bishop of Rome appointed his successor. For they were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13614,"a long time chosen by the People, as we may see by the sedition raised"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13615,"about the Election, between Damascus, and Ursinicus; which Ammianus"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13616,"Marcellinus saith was so great, that Juventius the Praefect, unable to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13617,"keep the peace between them, was forced to goe out of the City; and that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13618,there were above an hundred men found dead upon that occasion in the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13619,"Church it self. And though they afterwards were chosen, first, by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13620,"whole Clergy of Rome, and afterwards by the Cardinalls; yet never any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13621,was appointed to the succession by his predecessor. If therefore they
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13622,"pretended no right to appoint their successors, I think I may reasonably"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13623,"conclude, they had no right to appoint the new power; which none could"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13624,"take from the Church to bestow on them, but such as had a lawfull"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13625,"authority, not onely to Teach, but to Command the Church; which none"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13626,"could doe, but the Civill Soveraign."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13627,Ministers Of The Church What
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13628,The word Minister in the Originall Diakonos signifieth one that
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13629,voluntarily doth the businesse of another man; and differeth from a
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13630,"Servant onely in this, that Servants are obliged by their condition,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13631,to what is commanded them; whereas Ministers are obliged onely by
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13632,"their undertaking, and bound therefore to no more than that they have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13633,"undertaken: So that both they that teach the Word of God, and they that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13634,"administer the secular affairs of the Church, are both Ministers, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13635,"they are Ministers of different Persons. For the Pastors of the Church,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13636,"called (Acts 6.4.) ""The Ministers of the Word,"" are Ministers of Christ,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13637,"whose Word it is: But the Ministery of a Deacon, which is called (verse"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13638,"2. of the same Chapter) ""Serving of Tables,"" is a service done to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13639,"Church, or Congregation: So that neither any one man, nor the whole"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13640,"Church, could ever of their Pastor say, he was their Minister; but of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13641,"a Deacon, whether the charge he undertook were to serve tables, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13642,"distribute maintenance to the Christians, when they lived in each City"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13643,"on a common stock, or upon collections, as in the first times, or to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13644,"take a care of the House of Prayer, or of the Revenue, or other worldly"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13645,"businesse of the Church, the whole Congregation might properly call him"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13646,their Minister.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13647,"For their employment, as Deacons, was to serve the Congregation; though"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13648,"upon occasion they omitted not to preach the Gospel, and maintain the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13649,"Doctrine of Christ, every one according to his gifts, as S. Steven did;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13650,"and both to Preach, and Baptize, as Philip did: For that Philip, which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13651,"(Act. 8. 5.) Preached the Gospel at Samaria, and (verse 38.) Baptized"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13652,"the Eunuch, was Philip the Deacon, not Philip the Apostle. For it is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13653,"manifest (verse 1.) that when Philip preached in Samaria, the Apostles"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13654,"were at Jerusalem, and (verse 14.) ""When they heard that Samaria had"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13655,"received the Word of God, sent Peter and John to them;"" by imposition of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13656,"whose hands, they that were Baptized (verse 15.) received (which before"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13657,by the Baptisme of Philip they had not received) the Holy Ghost. For it
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13658,"was necessary for the conferring of the Holy Ghost, that their Baptisme"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13659,"should be administred, or confirmed by a Minister of the Word, not by a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13660,Minister of the Church. And therefore to confirm the Baptisme of those
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13661,"that Philip the Deacon had Baptized, the Apostles sent out of their own"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13662,"number from Jerusalem to Samaria, Peter, and John; who conferred on them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13663,"that before were but Baptized, those graces that were signs of the Holy"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13664,"Spirit, which at that time did accompany all true Beleevers; which what"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13665,they were may be understood by that which S. Marke saith (chap. 16.17.)
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13666,"""These signs follow them that beleeve in my Name; they shall cast out"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13667,"Devills; they shall speak with new tongues; They shall take up Serpents,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13668,"and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; They shall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13669,"lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover."" This to doe, was it that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13670,"Philip could not give; but the Apostles could, and (as appears by this"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13671,"place) effectually did to every man that truly beleeved, and was by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13672,a Minister of Christ himself Baptized: which power either Christs
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13673,"Ministers in this age cannot conferre, or else there are very few true"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13674,"Beleevers, or Christ hath very few Ministers."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13675,And How Chosen What
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13676,"That the first Deacons were chosen, not by the Apostles, but by a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13677,"Congregation of the Disciples; that is, of Christian men of all sorts,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13678,"is manifest out of Acts 6. where we read that the Twelve, after the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13679,"number of Disciples was multiplyed, called them together, and having"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13680,"told them, that it was not fit that the Apostles should leave the Word"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13681,"of God, and serve tables, said unto them (verse 3.) ""Brethren looke you"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13682,"out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost, and of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13683,"Wisdome, whom we may appoint over this businesse."" Here it is manifest,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13684,that though the Apostles declared them elected; yet the Congregation
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13685,"chose them; which also, (verse the fift) is more expressely said, where"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13686,"it is written, that ""the saying pleased the multitude, and they chose"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13687,"seven, &c."""
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13688,"Of Ecclesiasticall Revenue, Under The Law Of Moses"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13689,"Under the Old Testament, the Tribe of Levi were onely capable of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13690,"Priesthood, and other inferiour Offices of the Church. The land"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13691,"was divided amongst the other Tribes (Levi excepted,) which by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13692,"subdivision of the Tribe of Joseph, into Ephraim and Manasses, were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13693,still twelve. To the Tribe of Levi were assigned certain Cities for
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13694,"their habitation, with the suburbs for their cattell: but for their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13695,"portion, they were to have the tenth of the fruits of the land of their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13696,"Brethren. Again, the Priests for their maintenance had the tenth of that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13697,"tenth, together with part of the oblations, and sacrifices. For God had"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13698,"said to Aaron (Numb. 18. 20.) ""Thou shalt have no inheritance in their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13699,"land, neither shalt thou have any part amongst them, I am thy part, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13700,"thine inheritance amongst the Children of Israel."" For God being then"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13701,"King, and having constituted the Tribe of Levi to be his Publique"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13702,"Ministers, he allowed them for their maintenance, the Publique revenue,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13703,"that is to say, the part that God had reserved to himself; which were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13704,"Tythes, and Offerings: and that it is which is meant, where God saith, I"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13705,am thine inheritance. And therefore to the Levites might not unfitly
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13706,"be attributed the name of Clergy from Kleros, which signifieth Lot, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13707,"Inheritance; not that they were heirs of the Kingdome of God, more than"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13708,"other; but that Gods inheritance, was their maintenance. Now seeing"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13709,"in this time God himself was their King, and Moses, Aaron, and the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13710,"succeeding High Priests were his Lieutenants; it is manifest, that the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13711,"Right of Tythes, and Offerings was constituted by the Civill Power."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13712,"After their rejection of God in the demand of a King, they enjoyed still"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13713,"the same revenue; but the Right thereof was derived from that, that the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13714,Kings did never take it from them: for the Publique Revenue was at
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13715,the disposing of him that was the Publique Person; and that (till the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13716,"Captivity) was the King. And again, after the return from the Captivity,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13717,they paid their Tythes as before to the Priest. Hitherto therefore
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13718,Church Livings were determined by the Civill Soveraign.

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13819,"for beleeving in him, should be deposed, that is, subjected to any but"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13821,"the conservation of Peace amongst their Subjects, and for their defence"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13822,against foraign Enemies. And therefore Christian Kings are still the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13823,"Supreme Pastors of their people, and have power to ordain what Pastors"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13824,"they please, to teach the Church, that is, to teach the People committed"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13829,"the Right will be in the Civill Soveraign, Christian. For in that he is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13830,"a Christian, he allowes the Teaching; and in that he is the Soveraign"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13831,"(which is as much as to say, the Church by Representation,) the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13832,"Teachers hee elects, are elected by the Church. And when an Assembly of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13833,"Christians choose their Pastor in a Christian Common-wealth, it is the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13834,"Soveraign that electeth him, because tis done by his Authority; In the"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13837,without whose consent it is invalid. And therefore whatsoever examples
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13838,"may be drawn out of History, concerning the Election of Pastors, by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13839,"People, or by the Clergy, they are no arguments against the Right of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13840,"any Civill Soveraign, because they that elected them did it by his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13841,Authority.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13842,"Seeing then in every Christian Common-wealth, the Civill Soveraign is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13843,"the Supreme Pastor, to whose charge the whole flock of his Subjects is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13844,"committed, and consequently that it is by his authority, that all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13845,"other Pastors are made, and have power to teach, and performe all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13846,"other Pastorall offices; it followeth also, that it is from the Civill"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13847,"Soveraign, that all other Pastors derive their right of Teaching,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13848,"Preaching, and other functions pertaining to that Office; and that they"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13859,were to deprive himself of the Civill Power; which depending on the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13860,"opinion men have of their Duty to him, and the fear they have of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13861,"Punishment in another world, would depend also on the skill, and loyalty"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13862,"of Doctors, who are no lesse subject, not only to Ambition, but also"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13863,"to Ignorance, than any other sort of men. So that where a stranger hath"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13867,"Schoolmasters for their Subjects from the recommendation of a stranger,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13868,but not from the command; especially when the ill teaching them shall
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13869,redound to the great and manifest profit of him that recommends them:

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13892,contrary to the unity and defence of the Common-wealth.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13893,Christian Kings Have Power To Execute All Manner Of Pastoral Function
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13894,But if every Christian Soveraign be the Supreme Pastor of his own
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13895,"Subjects, it seemeth that he hath also the Authority, not only to Preach"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13896,"(which perhaps no man will deny;) but also to Baptize, and to Administer"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13897,"the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; and to Consecrate both Temples, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13898,Pastors to Gods service; which most men deny; partly because they use
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13899,"not to do it; and partly because the Administration of Sacraments,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13900,"and Consecration of Persons, and Places to holy uses, requireth the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13901,"Imposition of such mens hands, as by the like Imposition successively"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13902,from the time of the Apostles have been ordained to the like Ministery.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13903,"For proof therefore that Christian Kings have power to Baptize, and to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13904,"Consecrate, I am to render a reason, both why they use not to doe it,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13905,"and how, without the ordinary ceremony of Imposition of hands, they are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13906,"made capable of doing it, when they will."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13907,"There is no doubt but any King, in case he were skilfull in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13908,"Sciences, might by the same Right of his Office, read Lectures of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13909,"them himself, by which he authorizeth others to read them in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13910,"Universities. Neverthelesse, because the care of the summe of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13911,"businesse of the Common-wealth taketh up his whole time, it were not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13912,convenient for him to apply himself in Person to that particular. A King
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13913,"may also if he please, sit in Judgment, to hear and determine all manner"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13914,"of Causes, as well as give others authority to doe it in his name; but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13915,"that the charge that lyeth upon him of Command and Government, constrain"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13916,"him to bee continually at the Helm, and to commit the Ministeriall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13917,Offices to others under him. In the like manner our Saviour (who surely
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13918,"had power to Baptize) Baptized none himselfe, but sent his Apostles and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13919,"Disciples to Baptize. (John 4.2.) So also S. Paul, by the necessity of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13920,"Preaching in divers and far distant places, Baptized few: Amongst all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13921,"the Corinthians he Baptized only Crispus, Cajus, and Stephanus; (1"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13922,"Cor.1.14,16.) and the reason was, because his principall Charge was to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13923,"Preach. (1 Cor. 1.17.) Whereby it is manifest, that the greater Charge,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13924,"(such as is the Government of the Church,) is a dispensation for the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13925,"lesse. The reason therefore why Christian Kings use not to Baptize, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13926,"evident, and the same, for which at this day there are few Baptized by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13927,"Bishops, and by the Pope fewer."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13928,"And as concerning Imposition of Hands, whether it be needfull, for the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13929,"authorizing of a King to Baptize, and Consecrate, we may consider thus."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13930,"Imposition of Hands, was a most ancient publique ceremony amongst the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13931,"Jews, by which was designed, and made certain, the person, or other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13932,"thing intended in a mans prayer, blessing, sacrifice, consecration,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13933,"condemnation, or other speech. So Jacob in blessing the children of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13934,"Joseph (Gen. 48.14.) ""Laid his right Hand on Ephraim the younger, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13935,"his left Hand on Manasseh the first born;"" and this he did Wittingly"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13936,"(though they were so presented to him by Joseph, as he was forced in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13937,doing it to stretch out his arms acrosse) to design to whom he intended
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13938,"the greater blessing. So also in the sacrificing of the Burnt offering,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13939,"Aaron is commanded (Exod. 29.10.) ""to Lay his Hands on the head of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13940,"bullock;"" and (ver. 15.) ""to Lay his Hand on the head of the ramme."""
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13941,"The same is also said again, Levit. 1.4. & 8.14. Likewise Moses when he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13942,"ordained Joshua to be Captain of the Israelites, that is, consecrated"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13943,"him to Gods service, (Numb. 27.23.) ""Laid his hands upon him, and gave"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13947,"Levites."" And in the condemnation of him that had blasphemed the Lord"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13948,"(Levit. 24.14.) God commanded that ""all that heard him should Lay their"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13950,"why should they only that heard him, Lay their Hands upon him, and not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13951,"rather a Priest, Levite, or other Minister of Justice, but that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13952,"none else were able to design, and demonstrate to the eyes of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13953,"Congregation, who it was that had blasphemed, and ought to die? And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13954,"to design a man, or any other thing, by the Hand to the Eye is lesse"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13955,"subject to mistake, than when it is done to the Eare by a Name."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13956,"And so much was this ceremony observed, that in blessing the whole"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13957,"Congregation at once, which cannot be done by Laying on of Hands, yet"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13958,"""Aaron (Levit. 9.22.) did lift up his Hand towards the people when he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13959,"blessed them."" And we read also of the like ceremony of Consecration of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13960,"Temples amongst the Heathen, as that the Priest laid his Hands on"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13961,"some post of the Temple, all the while he was uttering the words of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13962,"Consecration. So naturall it is to design any individuall thing, rather"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13963,"by the Hand, to assure the Eyes, than by Words to inform the Eare in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13964,matters of Gods Publique service.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13965,This ceremony was not therefore new in our Saviours time. For Jairus

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13970,"According to this ancient Rite, the Apostles, and Presbyters, and the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13971,"Presbytery it self, Laid Hands on them whom they ordained Pastors, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13972,withall prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost; and that
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13973,"not only once, but sometimes oftner, when a new occasion was presented:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13974,"but the end was still the same, namely a punctuall, and religious"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13975,"designation of the person, ordained either to the Pastorall Charge"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13976,"in general, or to a particular Mission: so (Act. 6.6.) ""The Apostles"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13982,"laid their Hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost."" And not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13983,"only an Apostle, but a Presbyter had this power: For S. Paul adviseth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13984,"Timothy (1 Tim. 5.22.) ""Lay Hands suddenly on no man;"" that is, designe"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13985,no man rashly to the Office of a Pastor. The whole Presbytery Laid their
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13986,"Hands on Timothy, as we read 1 Tim. 4.14. but this is to be understood,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13987,"as that some did it by the appointment of the Presbytery, and most"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13988,"likely their Proestos, or Prolocutor, which it may be was St. Paul"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13989,"himself. For in his 2 Epist. to Tim. ver. 6. he saith to him, ""Stirre up"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13990,"the gift of God which is in thee, by the Laying on of my Hands:"" where"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13991,"note by the way, that by the Holy ghost, is not meant the third Person"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13992,"in the Trinity, but the Gifts necessary to the Pastorall Office. We read"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13993,"also, that St. Paul had Imposition of Hands twice; once from Ananias at"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13994,"Damascus (Acts 9.17,18.) at the time of his Baptisme; and again (Acts"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13995,"13.3.) at Antioch, when he was first sent out to Preach. The use then of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13996,"this ceremony considered in the Ordination of Pastors, was to design"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13997,the Person to whom they gave such Power. But if there had been then any
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13998,"Christian, that had had the Power of Teaching before; the Baptizing of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,13999,"him, that is the making of him a Christian, had given him no new Power,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14000,"but had onely caused him to preach true Doctrine, that is, to use"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14001,his Power aright; and therefore the Imposition of Hands had been
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14002,"unnecessary; Baptisme it selfe had been sufficient. But every Soveraign,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14003,"before Christianity, had the power of Teaching, and Ordaining Teachers;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14004,"and therefore Christianity gave them no new Right, but only directed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14005,them in the way of teaching truth; and consequently they needed
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14006,no Imposition of Hands (besides that which is done in Baptisme) to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14007,"authorize them to exercise any part of the Pastorall Function, as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14008,"namely, to Baptize, and Consecrate. And in the Old Testament, though"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14009,"the Priest only had right to Consecrate, during the time that the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14010,Soveraignty was in the High Priest; yet it was not so when the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14011,Soveraignty was in the King: For we read (1 Kings 8.) That Solomon

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14029,"exerciseth that Charge in anothers Dominion Jure Civili, in the Right of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14030,"the Civill Soveraign; not Jure Divino, in Gods Right; and may therefore"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14031,"be discharged of that Office, when the Soveraign for the good of his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14032,"Subjects shall think it necessary. They may also if they please,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14033,"commit the care of Religion to one Supreme Pastor, or to an Assembly of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14034,"Pastors; and give them what power over the Church, or one over another,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14035,"they think most convenient; and what titles of honor, as of Bishops,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14036,"Archbishops, Priests, or Presbyters, they will; and make such Laws for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14037,"their maintenance, either by Tithes, or otherwise, as they please,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14038,"so they doe it out of a sincere conscience, of which God onely is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14039,"the Judge. It is the Civill Soveraign, that is to appoint Judges, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14040,Interpreters of the Canonicall Scriptures; for it is he that maketh them
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14041,Laws. It is he also that giveth strength to Excommunications; which but
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14042,"for such Laws and Punishments, as may humble obstinate Libertines, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14043,"reduce them to union with the rest of the Church, would bee"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14044,"contemned. In summe, he hath the Supreme Power in all causes, as well"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14045,"Ecclesiasticall, as Civill, as far as concerneth actions, and words, for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14046,"these onely are known, and may be accused; and of that which cannot be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14047,"accused, there is no Judg at all, but God, that knoweth the heart."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14048,"And these Rights are incident to all Soveraigns, whether Monarchs, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14049,"Assemblies: for they that are the Representants of a Christian People,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14050,"are Representants of the Church: for a Church, and a Common-wealth of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14051,"Christian People, are the same thing."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14052,Cardinal Bellarmines Books De Summo Pontifice Considered
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14053,"Though this that I have here said, and in other places of this Book,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14054,seem cleer enough for the asserting of the Supreme Ecclesiasticall Power
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14055,to Christian Soveraigns; yet because the Pope of Romes challenge to that
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14056,"Power universally, hath been maintained chiefly, and I think as strongly"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14057,"as is possible, by Cardinall Bellarmine, in his Controversie De Summo"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14058,"Pontifice; I have thought it necessary, as briefly as I can, to examine"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14059,"the grounds, and strength of his Discourse."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14060,The First Book
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14061,"Of five Books he hath written of this subject, the first containeth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14062,"three Questions: One, Which is simply the best government, Monarchy,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14063,"Aristocracy, or Democracy; and concludeth for neither, but for a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14064,"government mixt of all there: Another, which of these is the best"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14065,"Government of the Church; and concludeth for the mixt, but which should"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14066,"most participate of Monarchy: the third, whether in this mixt Monarchy,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14067,"St. Peter had the place of Monarch. Concerning his first Conclusion, I"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14068,have already sufficiently proved (chapt. 18.) that all Governments which
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14069,"men are bound to obey, are Simple, and Absolute. In Monarchy there is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14070,but One Man Supreme; and all other men that have any kind of Power in
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14071,"the State, have it by his Commission, during his pleasure; and execute"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14072,"it in his name: And in Aristocracy, and Democracy, but One Supreme"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14073,"Assembly, with the same Power that in Monarchy belongeth to the Monarch,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14074,"which is not a Mixt, but an Absolute Soveraignty. And of the three"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14075,"sorts, which is the best, is not to be disputed, where any one of them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14076,"is already established; but the present ought alwaies to be preferred,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14077,"maintained, and accounted best; because it is against both the Law of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14078,"Nature, and the Divine positive Law, to doe any thing tending to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14079,"subversion thereof. Besides, it maketh nothing to the Power of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14080,"any Pastor, (unlesse he have the Civill Soveraignty,) what kind of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14081,Government is the best; because their Calling is not to govern men by
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14082,"Commandement, but to teach them, and perswade them by Arguments, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14083,"leave it to them to consider, whether they shall embrace, or reject the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14084,"Doctrine taught. For Monarchy, Aristocracy, and Democracy, do mark out"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14085,"unto us three sorts of Soveraigns, not of Pastors; or, as we may say,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14086,"three sorts of Masters of Families, not three sorts of Schoolmasters for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14087,their children.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14088,"And therefore the second Conclusion, concerning the best form of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14089,"Government of the Church, is nothing to the question of the Popes Power"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14090,without his own Dominions: For in all other Common-wealths his Power (if
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14091,"hee have any at all) is that of the Schoolmaster onely, and not of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14092,Master of the Family.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14093,"For the third Conclusion, which is, that St. Peter was Monarch of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14094,"Church, he bringeth for his chiefe argument the place of S. Matth."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14095,"(chap. 16.18, 19.) ""Thou art Peter, And upon this rock I will build my"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14096,"Church, &c. And I will give thee the keyes of Heaven; whatsoever thou"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14097,"shalt bind on Earth, shall be bound in Heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14098,"loose on Earth, shall be loosed in Heaven."" Which place well considered,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14099,"proveth no more, but that the Church of Christ hath for foundation one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14100,"onely Article; namely, that which Peter in the name of all the Apostles"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14101,"professing, gave occasion to our Saviour to speak the words here cited;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14102,"which that wee may cleerly understand, we are to consider, that our"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14103,"Saviour preached by himself, by John Baptist, and by his Apostles,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14104,"nothing but this Article of Faith, ""that he was the Christ;"" all other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14105,"Articles requiring faith no otherwise, than as founded on that. John"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14106,"began first, (Mat. 3.2.) preaching only this, ""The Kingdome of God is at"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14107,"hand."" Then our Saviour himself (Mat. 4.17.) preached the same: And to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14108,"his Twelve Apostles, when he gave them their Commission (Mat. 10.7.)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14109,there is no mention of preaching any other Article but that. This was
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14110,"the fundamentall Article, that is the Foundation of the Churches Faith."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14111,"Afterwards the Apostles being returned to him, he asketh them all, (Mat."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14112,"16.13) not Peter onely, ""Who men said he was;"" and they answered, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14113,"""some said he was John the Baptist, some Elias, and others Jeremias,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14114,"or one of the Prophets:"" Then (ver. 15.) he asked them all again, (not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14115,"Peter onely) ""Whom say yee that I am?"" Therefore Peter answered (for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14116,"them all) ""Thou art Christ, the Son of the Living God;"" which I said is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14117,the Foundation of the Faith of the whole Church; from which our Saviour
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14118,"takes the occasion of saying, ""Upon this stone I will build my Church;"""
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14119,"By which it is manifest, that by the Foundation-Stone of the Church, was"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14120,meant the Fundamentall Article of the Churches Faith. But why then (will
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14121,"some object) doth our Saviour interpose these words, ""Thou art Peter""?"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14122,"If the originall of this text had been rigidly translated, the reason"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14123,"would easily have appeared: We are therefore to consider, that the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14124,"Apostle Simon, was surnamed Stone, (which is the signification of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14125,"the Syriacke word Cephas, and of the Greek word Petrus). Our Saviour"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14126,"therefore after the confession of that Fundamentall Article, alluding"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14127,"to his name, said (as if it were in English) thus, Thou art ""Stone,"" and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14128,"upon this Stone I will build my Church: which is as much as to say, this"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14129,"Article, that ""I am the Christ,"" is the Foundation of all the Faith I"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14130,require in those that are to bee members of my Church: Neither is this
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14131,"allusion to a name, an unusuall thing in common speech: But it had been"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14132,"a strange, and obscure speech, if our Saviour intending to build his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14133,"Church on the Person of St. Peter, had said, ""thou art a Stone, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14134,"upon this Stone I will build my Church,"" when it was so obvious without"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14135,"ambiguity to have said, ""I will build my Church on thee; and yet there"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14136,had been still the same allusion to his name.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14137,"And for the following words, ""I will give thee the Keyes of Heaven, &c."""
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14138,it is no more than what our Saviour gave also to all the rest of his
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14139,"Disciples (Matth. 18.18.) ""Whatsoever yee shall bind on Earth, shall be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14140,"bound in Heaven. And whatsoever ye shall loose on Earth, shall be loosed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14141,"in Heaven."" But howsoever this be interpreted, there is no doubt but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14142,the Power here granted belongs to all Supreme Pastors; such as are all
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14143,"Christian Civill Soveraignes in their own Dominions. In so much, as if"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14144,"St. Peter, or our Saviour himself had converted any of them to beleeve"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14145,"him, and to acknowledge his Kingdome; yet because his Kingdome is not of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14146,"this world, he had left the supreme care of converting his subjects to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14147,"none but him; or else hee must have deprived him of the Soveraignty,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14148,to which the Right of Teaching is inseparably annexed. And thus much in
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14149,"refutation of his first Book, wherein hee would prove St. Peter to have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14150,"been the Monarch Universall of the Church, that is to say, of all the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14151,Christians in the world.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14152,The Second Book
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14153,"The second Book hath two Conclusions: One, that S. Peter was Bishop"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14154,"of Rome, and there dyed: The other, that the Popes of Rome are his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14155,Successors. Both which have been disputed by others. But supposing them
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14156,to be true; yet if by Bishop of Rome bee understood either the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14157,"Monarch of the Church, or the Supreme Pastor of it; not Silvester, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14158,Constantine (who was the first Christian Emperour) was that Bishop; and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14159,"as Constantine, so all other Christian Emperors were of Right supreme"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14160,"Bishops of the Roman Empire; I say of the Roman Empire, not of all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14161,Christendome: For other Christian Soveraigns had the same Right in their
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14162,"severall Territories, as to an Office essentially adhaerent to their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14163,Soveraignty. Which shall serve for answer to his second Book.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14164,The Third Book
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14165,"In the third Book, he handleth the question whether the Pope be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14166,"Antichrist. For my part, I see no argument that proves he is so, in that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14167,sense that Scripture useth the name: nor will I take any argument from
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14168,"the quality of Antichrist, to contradict the Authority he exerciseth,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14169,"or hath heretofore exercised in the Dominions of any other Prince, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14170,State.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14171,"It is evident that the Prophets of the Old Testament foretold, and the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14172,"Jews expected a Messiah, that is, a Christ, that should re-establish"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14173,"amongst them the kingdom of God, which had been rejected by them in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14174,"the time of Samuel, when they required a King after the manner of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14175,"other Nations. This expectation of theirs, made them obnoxious to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14176,"Imposture of all such, as had both the ambition to attempt the attaining"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14177,"of the Kingdome, and the art to deceive the People by counterfeit"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14178,"miracles, by hypocriticall life, or by orations and doctrine plausible."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14179,"Our Saviour therefore, and his Apostles forewarned men of False"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14180,"Prophets, and of False Christs. False Christs, are such as pretend to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14181,"be the Christ, but are not, and are called properly Antichrists, in such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14182,"sense, as when there happeneth a Schisme in the Church by the election"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14183,"of two Popes, the one calleth the other Antipapa, or the false Pope."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14184,And therefore Antichrist in the proper signification hath two essentiall
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14185,"marks; One, that he denyeth Jesus to be Christ; and another that he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14186,professeth himselfe to bee Christ. The first Mark is set down by S. John
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14187,"in his 1 Epist. 4. ch. 3. ver. ""Every Spirit that confesseth not that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14188,"Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is not of God; And this is the Spirit"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14189,"of Antichrist."" The other Mark is expressed in the words of our Saviour,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14190,"(Mat. 24.5.) ""Many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ;"" and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14191,"again, ""If any man shall say unto you, Loe, here is Christ, there is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14192,"Christ beleeve it not."" And therefore Antichrist must be a False Christ,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14193,"that is, some one of them that shall pretend themselves to be Christ."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14194,"And out of these two Marks, ""to deny Jesus to be the Christ,"" and to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14195,"""affirm himselfe to be the Christ,"" it followeth, that he must also be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14196,"an ""Adversary of the true Christ,"" which is another usuall signification"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14197,"of the word Antichrist. But of these many Antichrists, there is one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14198,"speciall one, O Antichristos, The Antichrist, or Antichrist definitely,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14199,as one certaine person; not indefinitely An Antichrist. Now seeing the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14200,"Pope of Rome, neither pretendeth himself, nor denyeth Jesus to be the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14201,"Christ, I perceive not how he can be called Antichrist; by which word"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14202,"is not meant, one that falsely pretendeth to be His Lieutenant, or Vicar"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14203,"Generall, but to be Hee. There is also some Mark of the time of this"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14204,"speciall Antichrist, as (Mat. 24.15.) when that abominable Destroyer,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14205,"spoken of by Daniel, (Dan. 9. 27.) shall stand in the Holy place, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14206,"such tribulation as was not since the beginning of the world, nor ever"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14207,"shall be again, insomuch as if it were to last long, (ver. 22.) ""no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14208,flesh could be saved; but for the elects sake those days shall be
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14209,"shortened"" (made fewer). But that tribulation is not yet come; for it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14210,is to be followed immediately (ver. 29.) by a darkening of the Sun
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14211,"and Moon, a falling of the Stars, a concussion of the Heavens, and the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14212,"glorious coming again of our Saviour, in the cloudes. And therefore The"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14213,"Antichrist is not yet come; whereas, many Popes are both come and gone."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14214,"It is true, the Pope in taking upon him to give Laws to all Christian"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14215,"Kings, and Nations, usurpeth a Kingdome in this world, which Christ took"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14216,"not on him: but he doth it not As Christ, but as For Christ, wherein"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14217,there is nothing of the Antichrist.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14218,The Fourth Book
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14219,"In the fourth Book, to prove the Pope to be the supreme Judg in all"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14226,Texts For The Infallibility Of The Popes Judgement In Points Of Faith
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14227,"For the Infallibility of his Judgments, he alledgeth the Scriptures: and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14228,"first, that of Luke 22.31. ""Simon, Simon, Satan hath desired you that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14229,"hee may sift you as wheat; but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14230,"faile not; and when thou art converted, strengthen thy Brethren."" This,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14231,"according to Bellarmines exposition, is, that Christ gave here to Simon"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14232,"Peter two priviledges: one, that neither his Faith should fail, neither"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14233,"he, nor any of his successors should ever define any point concerning"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14234,"Faith, or Manners erroneously, or contrary to the definition of a former"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14237,"in the whole Scripture, that maketh more against the Popes Authority,"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14240,"betray him, and the day of killing the Passeover being come, our Saviour"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14241,"celebrated the same with his Apostles, which he said, till the Kingdome"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14242,"of God was come hee would doe no more; and withall told them, that one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14243,"of them was to betray him: Hereupon they questioned, which of them it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14244,should be; and withall (seeing the next Passeover their Master would
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14245,"celebrate should be when he was King) entred into a contention, who"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14246,"should then be the greater man. Our Saviour therefore told them, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14247,"the Kings of the Nations had Dominion over their Subjects, and are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14248,called by a name (in Hebrew) that signifies Bountifull; but I cannot

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14255,"domination, to weaken your faith of the future; but I have prayed for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14256,"thee, that thy faith shall not fail; Thou therefore (Note this,) being"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14257,"converted, and understanding my Kingdome as of another world, confirm"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14258,the same faith in thy Brethren: To which S. Peter answered (as one that

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14260,"with thee, not onely to Prison, but to Death."" Whereby it is manifest,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14261,"S. Peter had not onely no jurisdiction given him in this world, but a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14262,"charge to teach all the other Apostles, that they also should have none."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14263,And for the Infallibility of St. Peters sentence definitive in matter
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14264,"of Faith, there is no more to be attributed to it out of this Text, than"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14265,"that Peter should continue in the beleef of this point, namely, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14266,"Christ should come again, and possesse the Kingdome at the day of"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14277,Apostles to be contained in that name of Sheep; then it is the supreme
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14278,Power of Teaching: but it was onely for the time that there were no
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14279,Christian Soveraigns already possessed of that Supremacy. But I have
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14280,"already proved, that Christian Soveraignes are in their owne Dominions"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14286,"before, Soveraigns are supreme Teachers (in generall) by their Office"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14287,and therefore oblige themselves (by their Baptisme) to teach the

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14289,they doe it at the perill of their own souls; for it is at the hands
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14290,of the Heads of Families that God will require the account of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14291,"instruction of his Children and Servants. It is of Abraham himself,"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14313,"is meant, at least, All Truth Necessary To Salvation. But with this"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14314,"mitigation, he attributeth no more Infallibility to the Pope, than to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14315,"any man that professeth Christianity, and is not to be damned: For"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14323,"unlesse we shall also say, a man is obliged in conscience to set on"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14327,"in necessaries, then Christ hath not sufficiently provided for the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14328,Churches Salvation; because he hath commanded her to follow the Popes
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14329,"directions. But this Reason is invalid, unlesse he shew when, and where"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14330,"Christ commanded that, or took at all any notice of a Pope: Nay granting"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14331,whatsoever was given to S. Peter was given to the Pope; yet seeing there

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14335,"Lastly, it hath not been declared by the Church, nor by the Pope"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14336,"himselfe, that he is the Civill Soveraign of all the Christians in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14337,world; and therefore all Christians are not bound to acknowledge his
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14338,"Jurisdiction in point of Manners. For the Civill Soveraignty, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14339,"supreme Judicature in controversies of Manners, are the same thing: And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14340,"the Makers of Civill Laws, are not onely Declarers, but also Makers"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14343,with the Law of the Soveraign. And therefore when the Pope challengeth
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14344,"Supremacy in controversies of Manners, hee teacheth men to disobey the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14345,"Civill Soveraign; which is an erroneous Doctrine, contrary to the"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14355,"words alledged sound therefore thus. ""The man that will presume to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14356,"disobey the Civill Soveraign for the time being, or any of his Officers"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14357,"in the execution of their places, that man shall die, &c."" which is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14358,"cleerly for the Civill Soveraignty, against the Universall power of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14359,Pope.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14360,"Secondly, he alledgeth that of Matth. 16. ""Whatsoever yee shall bind,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14361,"&c."" and interpreteth it for such Binding as is attributed (Matth."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14362,"23.4.) to the Scribes and Pharisees, ""They bind heavy burthens, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14363,"grievous to be born, and lay them on mens shoulders;"" by which is meant"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14364,"(he sayes) Making of Laws; and concludes thence, the Pope can make"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14365,Laws. But this also maketh onely for the Legislative power of Civill
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14366,"Soveraigns: For the Scribes, and Pharisees sat in Moses Chaire,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14367,but Moses next under God was Soveraign of the People of Israel: and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14368,"therefore our Saviour commanded them to doe all that they should say,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14369,"but not all that they should do. That is, to obey their Laws, but not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14370,follow their Example.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14371,"The third place, is John 21.16. ""Feed my sheep;"" which is not a Power"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14384,"Father sent not our Saviour to make Laws in this present world, wee may"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14385,"conclude from the Text, that neither did our Saviour send S. Peter to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14386,"make Laws here, but to perswade men to expect his second comming with"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14387,"a stedfast faith; and in the mean time, if Subjects, to obey their"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14389,best to make their Subjects doe the same; which is the Office of a
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14390,Bishop. Therefore this place maketh most strongly for the joining of the

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14595,"him; wherein he doth truly, and ingenuously interpret that place. But"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14596,seeing Moses had the entire Soveraignty in the Common-wealth of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14597,"Jews, it is manifest, that it is thereby signified, that they had their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14598,"Authority from the Civill Soveraign: and therefore that place proveth,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14599,that Bishops in every Christian Common-wealth have their Authority from
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14600,"the Civill Soveraign; and from the Pope in his own Territories only, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14601,not in the Territories of any other State.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14602,"The second argument, is from the nature of Monarchy; wherein all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14603,"Authority is in one Man, and in others by derivation from him: But the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14604,"Government of the Church, he says, is Monarchicall. This also makes for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14605,Christian Monarchs. For they are really Monarchs of their own people;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14606,"that is, of their own Church (for the Church is the same thing with a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14607,"Christian people;) whereas the Power of the Pope, though hee were"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14609,"Craticall, but onely of Didacticall; For God accepteth not a forced, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14610,a willing obedience.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14611,"The third, is, from that the Sea of S. Peter is called by S. Cyprian,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14612,"the Head, the Source, the Roote, the Sun, from whence the Authority"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14613,of Bishops is derived. But by the Law of Nature (which is a better

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14615,"a man) the Civill Soveraign in every Common-wealth, is the Head, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14616,"Source, the Root, and the Sun, from which all Jurisdiction is derived."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14617,"And therefore, the Jurisdiction of Bishops, is derived from the Civill"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14618,Soveraign.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14619,"The fourth, is taken from the Inequality of their Jurisdictions: For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14620,"if God (saith he) had given it them immediately, he had given aswell"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14621,"Equality of Jurisdiction, as of Order: But wee see, some are Bishops but"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14626,"argument, if he had proved before, that the Pope had had an Universall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14627,"Jurisdiction over all Christians, had been for his purpose. But seeing"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14628,"that hath not been proved, and that it is notoriously known, the large"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14629,"Jurisdiction of the Pope was given him by those that had it, that is,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14630,"by the Emperours of Rome, (for the Patriarch of Constantinople, upon the"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14632,"and Seat of the Emperour, claimed to be equal to him,) it followeth,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14633,that all other Bishops have their Jurisdiction from the Soveraigns of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14634,the place wherein they exercise the same: And as for that cause they
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14635,have not their Authority De Jure Divino; so neither hath the Pope his De
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14636,"Jure Divino, except onely where hee is also the Civill Soveraign."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14637,"His fift argument is this, ""If Bishops have their Jurisdiction"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14638,"immediately from God, the Pope could not take it from them, for he can"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14639,"doe nothing contrary to Gods ordination;"" And this consequence is good,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14640,"and well proved. ""But, (saith he) the Pope can do this, and has done"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14641,"it."" This also is granted, so he doe it in his own Dominions, or in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14642,Dominions of any other Prince that hath given him that Power; but not
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14643,"universally, in Right of the Popedome: For that power belongeth to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14644,"every Christian Soveraign, within the bounds of his owne Empire, and is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14645,inseparable from the Soveraignty. Before the People of Israel had (by
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14646,"the commandment of God to Samuel) set over themselves a King, after the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14647,"manner of other Nations, the High Priest had the Civill Government; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14648,"none but he could make, nor depose an inferiour Priest: But that Power"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14649,"was afterwards in the King, as may be proved by this same argument of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14650,Bellarmine; For if the Priest (be he the High Priest or any other) had
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14651,"his Jurisdiction immediately from God, then the King could not take it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14652,"from him; ""for he could do nothing contrary to Gods ordinance: But it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14653,"is certain, that King Solomon (1 Kings 2.26.) deprived Abiathar the High"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14660,argument is good; I have therefore nothing to say against it. But it
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14661,"is an argument no lesse good, to prove the Pope himself to have no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14662,Jurisdiction in the Dominion of any other Prince.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14663,"Lastly, hee bringeth for argument, the testimony of two Popes, Innocent,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14664,"and Leo; and I doubt not but hee might have alledged, with as good"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14665,"reason, the testimonies of all the Popes almost since S. Peter: For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14666,"considering the love of Power naturally implanted in mankind, whosoever"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14667,"were made Pope, he would be tempted to uphold the same opinion."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14668,"Neverthelesse, they should therein but doe, as Innocent, and Leo did,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14669,"bear witnesse of themselves, and therefore their witness should not be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14670,good.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14671,Of The Popes Temporall Power
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14672,"In the fift Book he hath four Conclusions. The first is, ""That the Pope"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14673,"in not Lord of all the world:"" the second, ""that the Pope is not Lord"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14674,"of all the Christian world:"" The third, ""That the Pope (without his owne"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14675,"Territory) has not any Temporall Jurisdiction DIRECTLY:"" These three"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14676,"Conclusions are easily granted. The fourth is, ""That the Pope has (in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14677,"the Dominions of other Princes) the Supreme Temporall Power INDIRECTLY:"""
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14678,"which is denyed; unlesse he mean by Indirectly, that he has gotten it by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14679,"Indirect means; then is that also granted. But I understand, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14680,"when he saith he hath it Indirectly, he means, that such Temporall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14681,"Jurisdiction belongeth to him of Right, but that this Right is but a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14682,"Consequence of his Pastorall Authority, the which he could not exercise,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14683,unlesse he have the other with it: And therefore to the Pastorall Power
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14684,(which he calls Spirituall) the Supreme Power Civill is necessarily
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14685,"annexed; and that thereby hee hath a Right to change Kingdomes, giving"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14686,"them to one, and taking them from another, when he shall think it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14687,conduces to the Salvation of Souls.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14688,Before I come to consider the Arguments by which hee would prove this
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14689,"doctrine, it will not bee amisse to lay open the Consequences of it;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14690,"that Princes, and States, that have the Civill Soveraignty in their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14691,"severall Common-wealths, may bethink themselves, whether it bee"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14692,"convenient for them, and conducing to the good of their Subjects, of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14693,"whom they are to give an account at the day of Judgment, to admit the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14694,same.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14695,"When it is said, the Pope hath not (in the Territories of other States)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14696,"the Supreme Civill Power Directly; we are to understand, he doth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14697,"not challenge it, as other Civill Soveraigns doe, from the originall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14698,"submission thereto of those that are to be governed. For it is evident,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14699,"and has already been sufficiently in this Treatise demonstrated, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14700,"the Right of all Soveraigns, is derived originally from the consent of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14701,every one of those that are to bee governed; whether they that choose
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14702,"him, doe it for their common defence against an Enemy, as when they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14703,"agree amongst themselves to appoint a Man, or an Assembly of men to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14704,"protect them; or whether they doe it, to save their lives, by submission"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14705,"to a conquering Enemy. The Pope therefore, when he disclaimeth the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14706,"Supreme Civill Power over other States Directly, denyeth no more, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14707,"that his Right cometh to him by that way; He ceaseth not for all that,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14708,"to claime it another way; and that is, (without the consent of them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14709,"that are to be governed) by a Right given him by God, (which hee calleth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14710,"Indirectly,) in his Assumption to the Papacy. But by what way soever he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14711,"pretend, the Power is the same; and he may (if it bee granted to be his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14712,"Right) depose Princes and States, as often as it is for the Salvation"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14713,"of Soules, that is, as often as he will; for he claimeth also the Sole"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14714,"Power to Judge, whether it be to the salvation of mens Souls, or not."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14715,"And this is the Doctrine, not onely that Bellarmine here, and many other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14716,"Doctors teach in their Sermons and Books, but also that some"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14717,"Councells have decreed, and the Popes have decreed, and the Popes have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14718,"accordingly, when the occasion hath served them, put in practise. For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14719,"the fourth Councell of Lateran held under Pope Innocent the third, (in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14720,"the third Chap. De Haereticis,) hath this Canon. ""If a King at the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14721,"Popes admonition, doe not purge his Kingdome of Haeretiques, and being"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14722,"Excommunicate for the same, make not satisfaction within a year, his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14723,"subjects are absolved of their Obedience."" And the practise hereof hath"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14724,"been seen on divers occasions; as in the Deposing of Chilperique, King"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14725,of France; in the Translation of the Roman Empire to Charlemaine; in
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14726,the Oppression of John King of England; in Transferring the Kingdome
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14727,"of Navarre; and of late years, in the League against Henry the third of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14728,"France, and in many more occurrences. I think there be few Princes that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14729,"consider not this as Injust, and Inconvenient; but I wish they would"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14730,"all resolve to be Kings, or Subjects. Men cannot serve two Masters: They"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14731,"ought therefore to ease them, either by holding the Reins of Government"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14732,wholly in their own hands; or by wholly delivering them into the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14733,"hands of the Pope; that such men as are willing to be obedient, may be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14734,"protected in their obedience. For this distinction of Temporall, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14735,"Spirituall Power is but words. Power is as really divided, and as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14736,"dangerously to all purposes, by sharing with another Indirect Power, as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14737,with a Direct one. But to come now to his Arguments.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14738,"The first is this, ""The Civill Power is subject to the Spirituall:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14739,"Therefore he that hath the Supreme Power Spirituall, hath right to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14740,"command Temporall Princes, and dispose of their Temporalls in order to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14741,"the Spirituall. As for the distinction of Temporall, and Spirituall,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14742,"let us consider in what sense it may be said intelligibly, that the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14743,"Temporall, or Civill Power is subject to the Spirituall. There be but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14744,"two ways that those words can be made sense. For when wee say, one Power"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14745,"is subject to another Power, the meaning either is, that he which hath"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14746,"the one, is subject to him that hath the other; or that the one Power is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14747,"to the other, as the means to the end. For wee cannot understand, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14748,one Power hath Power over another Power; and that one Power can have
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14749,"Right or Command over another: For Subjection, Command, Right, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14750,"Power are accidents, not of Powers, but of Persons: One Power may be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14751,"subordinate to another, as the art of a Sadler, to the art of a Rider."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14752,"If then it be granted, that the Civill Government be ordained as a means"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14753,"to bring us to a Spirituall felicity; yet it does not follow, that if a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14754,"King have the Civill Power, and the Pope the Spirituall, that therefore"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14755,"the King is bound to obey the Pope, more then every Sadler is bound to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14756,"obey every Rider. Therefore as from Subordination of an Art, cannot be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14757,inferred the Subjection of the Professor; so from the Subordination of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14758,"a Government, cannot be inferred the Subjection of the Governor. When"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14759,"therefore he saith, the Civill Power is Subject to the Spirituall, his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14760,"meaning is, that the Civill Soveraign, is Subject to the Spirituall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14761,"Soveraign. And the Argument stands thus, ""The Civil Soveraign, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14762,subject to the Spirituall; Therefore the Spirituall Prince may
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14763,"command Temporall Princes."" Where the conclusion is the same, with the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14764,"Antecedent he should have proved. But to prove it, he alledgeth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14765,"first, this reason, ""Kings and Popes, Clergy and Laity make but one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14766,"Common-wealth; that is to say, but one Church: And in all Bodies the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14767,Members depend one upon another: But things Spirituall depend not
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14768,"of things Temporall: Therefore, Temporall depend on Spirituall. And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14769,"therefore are Subject to them."" In which Argumentation there be two"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14770,"grosse errours: one is, that all Christian Kings, Popes, Clergy, and all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14771,"other Christian men, make but one Common-wealth: For it is evident that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14772,"France is one Common-wealth, Spain another, and Venice a third, &c. And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14773,these consist of Christians; and therefore also are severall Bodies
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14774,"of Christians; that is to say, severall Churches: And their severall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14775,"Soveraigns Represent them, whereby they are capable of commanding and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14776,"obeying, of doing and suffering, as a natural man; which no Generall or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14777,"Universall Church is, till it have a Representant; which it hath not on"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14778,"Earth: for if it had, there is no doubt but that all Christendome were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14779,"one Common-wealth, whose Soveraign were that Representant, both in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14780,"things Spirituall and Temporall: And the Pope, to make himself this"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14781,"Representant, wanteth three things that our Saviour hath not given"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14782,"him, to Command, and to Judge, and to Punish, otherwise than (by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14783,Excommunication) to run from those that will not Learn of him: For
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14784,"though the Pope were Christs onely Vicar, yet he cannot exercise his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14785,"government, till our Saviours second coming: And then also it is not the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14786,"Pope, but St. Peter himselfe, with the other Apostles, that are to be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14787,Judges of the world.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14788,"The other errour in this his first Argument is, that he sayes, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14789,"Members of every Common-wealth, as of a naturall Body, depend one of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14790,"another: It is true, they cohaere together; but they depend onely on the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14791,"Soveraign, which is the Soul of the Common-wealth; which failing, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14792,"Common-wealth is dissolved into a Civill war, no one man so much"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14793,"as cohaering to another, for want of a common Dependance on a known"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14794,"Soveraign; Just as the Members of the naturall Body dissolve into Earth,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14795,for want of a Soul to hold them together. Therefore there is nothing in
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14796,"this similitude, from whence to inferre a dependance of the Laity on the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14797,"Clergy, or of the Temporall Officers on the Spirituall; but of both on"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14798,the Civill Soveraign; which ought indeed to direct his Civill commands
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14799,to the Salvation of Souls; but is not therefore subject to any but God
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14800,"himselfe. And thus you see the laboured fallacy of the first Argument,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14801,to deceive such men as distinguish not between the Subordination of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14802,Actions in the way to the End; and the Subjection of Persons one to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14803,"another in the administration of the Means. For to every End, the Means"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14804,"are determined by Nature, or by God himselfe supernaturally: but the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14805,"Power to make men use the Means, is in every nation resigned (by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14806,"Law of Nature, which forbiddeth men to violate their Faith given) to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14807,Civill Soveraign.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14808,"His second Argument is this, ""Every Common-wealth, (because it is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14809,"supposed to be perfect and sufficient in it self,) may command any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14810,"other Common-wealth, not subject to it, and force it to change the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14811,"administration of the Government, nay depose the Prince, and set another"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14812,"in his room, if it cannot otherwise defend it selfe against the injuries"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14813,he goes about to doe them: much more may a Spirituall Common-wealth
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14814,command a Temporall one to change the administration of their
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14815,"Government, and may depose Princes, and institute others, when they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14816,"cannot otherwise defend the Spirituall Good."""
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14817,"That a Common-wealth, to defend it selfe against injuries, may lawfully"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14818,"doe all that he hath here said, is very true; and hath already in that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14819,which hath gone before been sufficiently demonstrated. And if it were
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14820,"also true, that there is now in this world a Spirituall Common-wealth,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14821,"distinct from a Civill Common-wealth, then might the Prince thereof,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14822,"upon injury done him, or upon want of caution that injury be not done"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14823,"him in time to come, repaire, and secure himself by Warre; which is in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14824,"summe, deposing, killing, or subduing, or doing any act of Hostility."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14825,"But by the same reason, it would be no lesse lawfull for a Civill"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14826,"Soveraign, upon the like injuries done, or feared, to make warre"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14827,upon the Spirituall Soveraign; which I beleeve is more than Cardinall
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14828,Bellarmine would have inferred from his own proposition.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14829,But Spirituall Common-wealth there is none in this world: for it is the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14830,"same thing with the Kingdome of Christ; which he himselfe saith, is not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14831,"of this world; but shall be in the next world, at the Resurrection, when"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14832,"they that have lived justly, and beleeved that he was the Christ, shall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14833,(though they died Naturall bodies) rise Spirituall bodies; and then it
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14834,"is, that our Saviour shall judge the world, and conquer his Adversaries,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14835,"and make a Spirituall Common-wealth. In the mean time, seeing there are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14836,"no men on earth, whose bodies are Spirituall; there can be no Spirituall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14837,Common-wealth amongst men that are yet in the flesh; unlesse wee call
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14838,"Preachers, that have Commission to Teach, and prepare men for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14839,"their reception into the Kingdome of Christ at the Resurrection, a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14840,Common-wealth; which I have proved to bee none.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14841,"The third Argument is this; ""It is not lawfull for Christians to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14842,"tolerate an Infidel, or Haereticall King, in case he endeavour to draw"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14843,"them to his Haeresie, or Infidelity. But to judge whether a King draw"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14844,"his subjects to Haeresie, or not, belongeth to the Pope. Therefore hath"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14845,"the Pope Right, to determine whether the Prince be to be deposed, or not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14846,"deposed."""
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14847,"To this I answer, that both these assertions are false. For Christians,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14848,"(or men of what Religion soever,) if they tolerate not their King,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14849,"whatsoever law hee maketh, though it bee concerning Religion, doe"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14850,"violate their faith, contrary to the Divine Law, both Naturall and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14851,"Positive: Nor is there any Judge of Haeresie amongst Subjects, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14852,"their own Civill Soveraign; for ""Haeresie is nothing else, but a private"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14853,"opinion, obstinately maintained, contrary to the opinion which the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14854,"Publique Person (that is to say, the Representant of the Common-wealth)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14855,"hath commanded to bee taught."" By which it is manifest, that an"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14856,"opinion publiquely appointed to bee taught, cannot be Haeresie; nor the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14857,"Soveraign Princes that authorize them, Haeretiques. For Haeretiques are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14858,"none but private men, that stubbornly defend some Doctrine, prohibited"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14859,by their lawful Soveraigns.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14860,"But to prove that Christians are not to tolerate Infidell, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14861,"Haereticall Kings, he alledgeth a place in Deut. 17. where God"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14862,"forbiddeth the Jews, when they shall set a King over themselves, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14863,"choose a stranger; And from thence inferreth, that it is unlawfull for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14864,"a Christian, to choose a King, that is not a Christian. And 'tis true,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14865,"that he that is a Christian, that is, hee that hath already obliged"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14866,"himself to receive our Saviour when he shall come, for his King, shal"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14867,"tempt God too much in choosing for King in this world, one that hee"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14868,"knoweth will endeavour, both by terrour, and perswasion to make him"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14869,"violate his faith. But, it is (saith hee) the same danger, to choose one"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14871,"is chosen. To this I say, the question is not of the danger of not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14872,"deposing; but of the Justice of deposing him. To choose him, may in some"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14873,"cases bee unjust; but to depose him, when he is chosen, is in no case"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14874,"Just. For it is alwaies violation of faith, and consequently against the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14875,"Law of Nature, which is the eternal Law of God. Nor doe wee read, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14876,any such Doctrine was accounted Christian in the time of the Apostles;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14877,"nor in the time of the Romane Emperours, till the Popes had the Civill"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14878,"Soveraignty of Rome. But to this he hath replyed, that the Christians of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14879,"old, deposed not Nero, nor Diocletian, nor Julian, nor Valens an Arrian,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14880,"for this cause onely, that they wanted Temporall forces. Perhaps so. But"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14881,"did our Saviour, who for calling for, might have had twelve Legions"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14882,"of immortall, invulnerable Angels to assist him, want forces to depose"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14883,"Caesar, or at least Pilate, that unjustly, without finding fault in him,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14884,delivered him to the Jews to bee crucified? Or if the Apostles wanted
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14885,"Temporall forces to depose Nero, was it therefore necessary for them in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14886,"their Epistles to the new made Christians, to teach them, (as they did)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14887,"to obey the Powers constituted over them, (whereof Nero in that time was"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14888,"one,) and that they ought to obey them, not for fear of their wrath,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14889,"but for conscience sake? Shall we say they did not onely obey, but also"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14890,"teach what they meant not, for want of strength? It is not therefore"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14891,"for want of strength, but for conscience sake, that Christians are to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14892,"tolerate their Heathen Princes, or Princes (for I cannot call any one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14893,"whose Doctrine is the Publique Doctrine, an Haeretique) that authorize"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14894,the teaching of an Errour. And whereas for the Temporall Power of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14895,"Pope, he alledgeth further, that St. Paul (1 Cor. 6.) appointed Judges"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14896,"under the Heathen Princes of those times, such as were not ordained by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14897,"those Princes; it is not true. For St. Paul does but advise them,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14898,"to take some of their Brethren to compound their differences, as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14899,"Arbitrators, rather than to goe to law one with another before the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14900,"Heathen Judges; which is a wholsome Precept, and full of Charity, fit"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14901,to bee practised also in the Best Christian Common-wealths. And for
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14902,"the danger that may arise to Religion, by the Subjects tolerating of an"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14903,"Heathen, or an Erring Prince, it is a point, of which a Subject is no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14904,"competent Judge; or if hee bee, the Popes Temporall Subjects may judge"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14905,"also of the Popes Doctrine. For every Christian Prince, as I have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14906,"formerly proved, is no lesse Supreme Pastor of his own Subjects, than"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14907,the Pope of his.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14908,"The fourth Argument, is taken from the Baptisme of Kings; wherein, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14909,they may be made Christians they submit their Scepters to Christ; and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14910,"promise to keep, and defend the Christian Faith. This is true; for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14911,"Christian Kings are no more but Christs Subjects: but they may, for all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14912,"that, bee the Popes Fellowes; for they are Supreme Pastors of their own"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14915,"The fifth Argument, is drawn from the words spoken by our Saviour, Feed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14916,My Sheep; by which was give all Power necessary for a Pastor; as the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14917,"Power to chase away Wolves, such as are Haeretiques; the Power to shut"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14918,"up Rammes, if they be mad, or push at the other Sheep with their Hornes,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14919,such as are Evill (though Christian) Kings; and Power to give the Flock
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14920,"convenient food: From whence hee inferreth, that St. Peter had these"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14921,"three Powers given him by Christ. To which I answer, that the last of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14922,"these Powers, is no more than the Power, or rather Command to Teach."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14923,"For the first, which is to chase away Wolves, that is, Haeretiques, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14924,"place hee quoteth is (Matth. 7.15.) ""Beware of false Prophets which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14925,"come to you in Sheeps clothing, but inwardly are ravening Wolves."""
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14926,"But neither are Haeretiques false Prophets, or at all Prophets: nor"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14927,"(admitting Haeretiques for the Wolves there meant,) were the Apostles"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14928,"commanded to kill them, or if they were Kings, to depose them; but to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14929,"beware of, fly, and avoid them: nor was it to St. Peter, nor to any of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14930,"the Apostles, but to the multitude of the Jews that followed him into"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14931,"the mountain, men for the most part not yet converted, that hee gave"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14932,"this Counsell, to Beware of false Prophets: which therefore if it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14933,"conferre a Power of chasing away Kings, was given, not onely to private"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14934,men; but to men that were not at all Christians. And as to the Power
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14935,"of Separating, and Shutting up of furious Rammes, (by which hee meaneth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14936,"Christian Kings that refuse to submit themselves to the Roman Pastor,)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14937,"our Saviour refused to take upon him that Power in this world himself,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14938,but advised to let the Corn and Tares grow up together till the day of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14939,"Judgment: much lesse did hee give it to St. Peter, or can S. Peter give"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14940,"it to the Popes. St. Peter, and all other Pastors, are bidden to esteem"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14941,"those Christians that disobey the Church, that is, (that disobey the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14942,"Christian Soveraigne) as Heathen men, and as Publicans. Seeing then men"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14943,"challenge to the Pope no authority over Heathen Princes, they ought to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14944,challenge none over those that are to bee esteemed as Heathen.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14945,"But from the Power to Teach onely, hee inferreth also a Coercive Power"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14946,"in the Pope, over Kings. The Pastor (saith he) must give his flock"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14947,"convenient food: Therefore the Pope may, and ought to compell Kings to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14948,"doe their duty. Out of which it followeth, that the Pope, as Pastor of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14949,"Christian men, is King of Kings: which all Christian Kings ought indeed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14950,"either to Confesse, or else they ought to take upon themselves the"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14952,"His sixth, and last Argument, is from Examples. To which I answer,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14953,"first, that Examples prove nothing; Secondly, that the Examples he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14954,alledgeth make not so much as a probability of Right. The fact of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14955,"Jehoiada, in Killing Athaliah (2 Kings 11.) was either by the Authority"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14956,"of King Joash, or it was a horrible Crime in the High Priest, which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14957,(ever after the election of King Saul) was a mere Subject. The fact of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14958,"St. Ambrose, in Excommunicating Theodosius the Emperour, (if it were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14959,"true hee did so,) was a Capitall Crime. And for the Popes, Gregory 1."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14960,"Greg. 2. Zachary, and Leo 3. their Judgments are void, as given in their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14961,"own Cause; and the Acts done by them conformably to this Doctrine, are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14962,the greatest Crimes (especially that of Zachary) that are incident to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,42,14963,Humane Nature. And thus much of Power Ecclesiasticall; wherein I had

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,14968,KINGDOME OF HEAVEN.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,14969,The Difficulty Of Obeying God And Man Both At Once
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,14970,"The most frequent praetext of Sedition, and Civill Warre, in Christian"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,14971,"Common-wealths hath a long time proceeded from a difficulty, not yet"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,14972,"sufficiently resolved, of obeying at once, both God, and Man, then"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,14973,when their Commandements are one contrary to the other. It is manifest
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,14974,"enough, that when a man receiveth two contrary Commands, and knows that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,14975,"one of them is Gods, he ought to obey that, and not the other, though"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,14976,"it be the command even of his lawfull Soveraign (whether a Monarch, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,14977,"a Soveraign Assembly,) or the command of his Father. The difficulty"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,14978,"therefore consisteth in this, that men when they are commanded in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,14979,"name of God, know not in divers Cases, whether the command be from God,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,14980,"or whether he that commandeth, doe but abuse Gods name for some private"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,14981,"ends of his own. For as there ware in the Church of the Jews, many false"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,14982,"Prophets, that sought reputation with the people, by feigned Dreams, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,14983,"Visions; so there have been in all times in the Church of Christ, false"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,14988,Necessary To Salvation
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,14989,"But this difficulty of obeying both God, and the Civill Soveraign on"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,14991,"is not Necessary for their Reception into the Kingdome of God, is of no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,14992,"moment. For if the command of the Civill Soveraign bee such, as that it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,14993,"may be obeyed, without the forfeiture of life Eternall; not to obey it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,14994,"is unjust; and the precept of the Apostle takes place; ""Servants obey"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,14995,"your Masters in all things;"" and, ""Children obey your Parents in all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,14996,"things;"" and the precept of our Saviour, ""The Scribes and Pharisees sit"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,14997,"in Moses Chaire, All therefore they shall say, that observe, and doe."""
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,14998,"But if the command be such, as cannot be obeyed, without being damned"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,14999,"to Eternall Death, then it were madnesse to obey it, and the Counsell"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15000,"of our Saviour takes place, (Mat. 10. 28.) ""Fear not those that kill the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15001,"body, but cannot kill the soule."" All men therefore that would avoid,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15002,"both the punishments that are to be in this world inflicted, for"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15006,Eternall Salvation.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15007,All That Is Necessary To Salvation Is Contained In Faith And Obedience
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15008,"All that is NECESSARY to Salvation, is contained in two Vertues, Faith"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15009,"in Christ, and Obedience to Laws. The latter of these, if it were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15010,"perfect, were enough to us. But because wee are all guilty of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15011,"disobedience to Gods Law, not onely originally in Adam, but also"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15012,"actually by our own transgressions, there is required at our hands now,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15013,"not onely Obedience for the rest of our time, but also a Remission of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15014,sins for the time past; which Remission is the reward of our Faith
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15015,"in Christ. That nothing else is Necessarily required to Salvation, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15016,"manifest from this, that the Kingdome of Heaven, is shut to none but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15017,"to Sinners; that is to say, to the disobedient, or transgressors of the"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15020,What Obedience Is Necessary;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15021,"The Obedience required at our hands by God, that accepteth in all our"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15022,"actions the Will for the Deed, is a serious Endeavour to Obey him;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15023,and is called also by all such names as signifie that Endeavour. And
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15024,"therefore Obedience, is sometimes called by the names of Charity, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15025,"Love, because they imply a Will to Obey; and our Saviour himself maketh"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15026,"our Love to God, and to one another, a Fulfilling of the whole Law: and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15027,sometimes by the name of Righteousnesse; for Righteousnesse is but the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15028,"will to give to every one his owne, that is to say, the will to obey"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15029,"the Laws: and sometimes by the name of Repentance; because to Repent,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15030,"implyeth a turning away from sinne, which is the same, with the return"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15031,of the will to Obedience. Whosoever therefore unfeignedly desireth
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15032,"to fulfill the Commandements of God, or repenteth him truely of his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15033,"transgressions, or that loveth God with all his heart, and his neighbor"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15037,And To What Laws
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15038,But what Commandements are those that God hath given us? Are all
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15039,"those Laws which were given to the Jews by the hand of Moses, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15040,"Commandements of God? If they bee, why are not Christians taught to obey"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15041,"them? If they be not, what others are so, besides the Law of Nature? For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15042,"our Saviour Christ hath not given us new Laws, but Counsell to observe"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15043,"those wee are subject to; that is to say, the Laws of Nature, and the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15044,Laws of our severall Soveraigns: Nor did he make any new Law to the Jews
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15045,"in his Sermon on the Mount, but onely expounded the Laws of Moses, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15046,which they were subject before. The Laws of God therefore are none
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15047,"but the Laws of Nature, whereof the principall is, that we should"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15049,"Soveraigns, which wee constituted over us, by mutuall pact one with"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15063,"therefore, whom Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses and the Prophets beleeved,"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15084,The Causes Of Christian Faith
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15085,"The causes why men beleeve any Christian Doctrine, are various; For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15086,"Faith is the gift of God; and he worketh it in each severall man, by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15087,"such wayes, as it seemeth good unto himself. The most ordinary immediate"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15088,"cause of our beleef, concerning any point of Christian Faith, is, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15089,wee beleeve the Bible to be the Word of God. But why wee beleeve the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15090,"Bible to be the Word of God, is much disputed, as all questions must"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15091,"needs bee, that are not well stated. For they make not the question"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15092,"to be, ""Why we Beleeve it,"" but ""How wee Know it;"" as if Beleeving and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15093,Knowing were all one. And thence while one side ground their Knowledge
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15094,"upon the Infallibility of the Church, and the other side, on the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15095,"Testimony of the Private Spirit, neither side concludeth what it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15096,"pretends. For how shall a man know the Infallibility of the Church, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15097,by knowing first the Infallibility of the Scripture? Or how shall a man
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15098,"know his own Private spirit to be other than a beleef, grounded upon the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15099,"Authority, and Arguments of his Teachers; or upon a Presumption of his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15100,"own Gifts? Besides, there is nothing in the Scripture, from which can be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15101,"inferred the Infallibility of the Church; much lesse, of any particular"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15102,"Church; and least of all, the Infallibility of any particular man."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15103,Faith Comes By Hearing
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15104,"It is manifest, therefore, that Christian men doe not know, but onely"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15105,beleeve the Scripture to be the Word of God; and that the means of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15106,"making them beleeve which God is pleased to afford men ordinarily, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15107,"according to the way of Nature, that is to say, from their Teachers."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15108,"It is the Doctrine of St. Paul concerning Christian Faith in generall,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15109,"(Rom. 10.17.) ""Faith cometh by Hearing,"" that is, by Hearing our lawfull"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15110,"Pastors. He saith also (ver. 14,15. of the same Chapter) ""How shall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15111,they beleeve in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15112,"without a Preacher? and how shall they Preach, except they be sent?"""
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15113,"Whereby it is evident, that the ordinary cause of beleeving that the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15114,"Scriptures are the Word of God, is the same with the cause of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15115,"beleeving of all other Articles of our Faith, namely, the Hearing of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15116,"those that are by the Law allowed and appointed to Teach us, as our"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15118,is made more manifest by experience. For what other cause can there bee
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15119,"assigned, why in Christian Common-wealths all men either beleeve, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15120,"at least professe the Scripture to bee the Word of God, and in other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15121,Common-wealths scarce any; but that in Christian Common-wealths they
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15122,are taught it from their infancy; and in other places they are taught
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15123,otherwise?
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15124,"But if Teaching be the cause of Faith, why doe not all beleeve? It is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15125,"certain therefore that Faith is the gift of God, and hee giveth it to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15126,"whom he will. Neverthelesse, because of them to whom he giveth it, he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15127,"giveth it by the means of Teachers, the immediate cause of Faith is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15128,"Hearing. In a School where many are taught, and some profit, others"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15129,"profit not, the cause of learning in them that profit, is the Master;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15130,"yet it cannot be thence inferred, that learning is not the gift of God."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15131,"All good things proceed from God; yet cannot all that have them, say"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15132,"they are Inspired; for that implies a gift supernaturall, and the"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15136,"of God; if out of such places of them, as are without obscurity, I"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15148,Necessary.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15149,Proved From The Scope Of The Evangelists
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15150,"For Proof that the Beleef of this Article, Jesus Is The Christ, is all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15151,"the Faith required to Salvation, my first Argument shall bee from the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15152,Scope of the Evangelists; which was by the description of the life of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15153,"our Saviour, to establish that one Article, Jesus Is The Christ. The"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15154,"summe of St. Matthews Gospell is this, That Jesus was of the stock of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15155,David; Born of a Virgin; which are the Marks of the true Christ: That
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15156,the Magi came to worship him as King of the Jews: That Herod for the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15157,same cause sought to kill him: That John Baptist proclaimed him: That
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15158,"he preached by himselfe, and his Apostles that he was that King; That"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15159,"he taught the Law, not as a Scribe, but as a man of Authority: That he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15160,"cured diseases by his Word onely, and did many other Miracles, which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15161,were foretold the Christ should doe: That he was saluted King when he
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15162,entered into Jerusalem: That he fore-warned them to beware of all others
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15163,"that should pretend to be Christ: That he was taken, accused, and put"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15164,"to death, for saying, hee was King: That the cause of his condemnation"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15165,"written on the Crosse, was JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWES."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15166,"All which tend to no other end than this, that men should beleeve,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15167,that Jesus Is The Christ. Such therefore was the Scope of St. Matthews
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15168,Gospel. But the Scope of all the Evangelists (as may appear by reading
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15169,"them) was the same. Therefore the Scope of the whole Gospell, was the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15170,establishing of that onely Article. And St. John expressely makes it his

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15175,"Apostles, both whilest our Saviour lived on earth, and after his"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15209,"The fourth Argument is taken from places expresse, and such as receive"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15210,"no controversie of Interpretation; as first, John 5. 39. ""Search the"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15215,"Testament hath nothing of Christ, but the Markes by which men might"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15218,"to beleeve that this Jesus was He, was sufficient to eternall life: but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15219,more than sufficient is not Necessary; and consequently no other Article
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15220,"is required. Again, (John 11. 26.) ""Whosoever liveth and beleeveth in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15221,"mee, shall not die eternally,"" Therefore to beleeve in Christ, is faith"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15222,sufficient to eternall life; and consequently no more faith than that
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15223,"is Necessary, But to beleeve in Jesus, and to beleeve that Jesus is the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15224,"Christ, is all one, as appeareth in the verses immediately following."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15225,"For when our Saviour (verse 26.) had said to Martha, ""Beleevest thou"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15228,this Article alone is faith sufficient to life eternall; and more than
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15229,"sufficient is not Necessary. Thirdly, John 20. 31. ""These things are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15230,"written that yee might beleeve, that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15254,though hee that shall teach the contrary should doe great miracles. The
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15255,"second place is Gal. 1. 8. ""Though we, or an Angell from Heaven preach"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15260,"an Angell from heaven; much more of any mortall man, if he teach the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15261,contrary. This is therefore the Fundamentall Article of Christian Faith.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15262,"A third place is, 1 Joh. 4.1. ""Beloved, beleeve not every spirit. Hereby"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15263,yee shall know the Spirit of God; every spirit that confesseth that
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15264,"Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God."" By which it is evident,"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15281,"and partly allegoricall and difficult; out of that which is plain, may"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15282,"be inferred, that Pastors that teach this Foundation, that Jesus Is The"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15283,"Christ, though they draw from it false consequences, (which all men are"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15296,and saving of men as by Fire. The Apostle here seemeth to allude to

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15298,"Restauration of the Kingdome of God, saith thus, ""Two parts therein"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15299,"shall be cut off, and die, but the third shall be left therein; and"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15318,"Scripture, or any glimpse of the fire of Purgatory."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15319,In What Sense Other Articles May Be Called Necessary
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15320,"But a man may here aske, whether it bee not as necessary to Salvation,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15321,"to beleeve, that God is Omnipotent; Creator of the world; that Jesus"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15322,Christ is risen; and that all men else shall rise again from the dead
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15323,"at the last day; as to beleeve, that Jesus Is The Christ. To which I"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15324,"answer, they are; and so are many more Articles: but they are such, as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15325,"are contained in this one, and may be deduced from it, with more, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15326,"lesse difficulty. For who is there that does not see, that they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15327,"who beleeve Jesus to be the Son of the God of Israel, and that the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15328,"Israelites had for God the Omnipotent Creator of all things, doe therein"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15329,"also beleeve, that God is the Omnipotent Creator of all things? Or how"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15330,"can a man beleeve, that Jesus is the King that shall reign eternally,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15331,unlesse hee beleeve him also risen again from the dead? For a dead man
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15332,"cannot exercise the Office of a King. In summe, he that holdeth this"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15333,"Foundation, Jesus Is The Christ, holdeth Expressely all that hee"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15334,"seeth rightly deduced from it, and Implicitely all that is consequent"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15335,"thereunto, though he have not skill enough to discern the consequence."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15336,"And therefore it holdeth still good, that the beleef of this one Article"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15337,"is sufficient faith to obtaine remission of sinnes to the Penitent, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15338,consequently to bring them into the Kingdome of Heaven.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15339,"That Faith, And Obedience Are Both Of Them Necessary To Salvation"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15340,"Now that I have shewn, that all the Obedience required to Salvation,"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15345,Salvation is contained in both these joined together. The men to whom
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15346,"St. Peter preached on the day of Pentecost, next after the Ascension"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15347,"of our Saviour, asked him, and the rest of the Apostles, saying, (Act."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15348,"2.37.) ""Men and Brethren what shall we doe?"" to whom St. Peter answered"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15349,"(in the next verse) ""Repent, and be Baptized every one of you, for the"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15351,"Therefore Repentance, and Baptisme, that is, beleeving that Jesus Is The"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15352,"Christ, is all that is Necessary to Salvation. Again, our Saviour being"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15353,"asked by a certain Ruler, (Luke 18.18.) ""What shall I doe to inherit"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15354,"eternall life?"" Answered (verse 20) ""Thou knowest the Commandements,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15355,"Doe not commit Adultery, Doe not Kill, Doe not Steal, Doe not bear false"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15356,"witnesse, Honor thy Father, and thy Mother;"" which when he said he had"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15357,"observed, our Saviour added, ""Sell all thou hast, give it to the Poor,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15358,"and come and follow me:"" which was as much as to say, Relye on me that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15359,"am the King: Therefore to fulfill the Law, and to beleeve that Jesus"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15360,"is the King, is all that is required to bring a man to eternall life."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15361,"Thirdly, St. Paul saith (Rom. 1.17.) ""The Just shall live by Faith;"" not"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15363,"To Be Just, or Repentance) are all that is Necessary to life eternall."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15364,"And (Mark 1.15.) our Saviour preached, saying, ""The time is fulfilled,"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15366,"that is, the Good news that the Christ was come. Therefore to Repent,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15367,"and to Beleeve that Jesus is the Christ, is all that is required to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15368,Salvation.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15369,What Each Of Them Contributes Thereunto
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15370,"Seeing then it is Necessary that Faith, and Obedience (implyed in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15371,word Repentance) do both concurre to our Salvation; the question
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15372,"by which of the two we are Justified, is impertinently disputed."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15373,"Neverthelesse, it will not be impertinent, to make manifest in what"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15374,"manner each of them contributes thereunto; and in what sense it is said,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15375,"that we are to be Justified by the one, and by the other. And first,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15376,"if by Righteousnesse be understood the Justice of the Works themselves,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15377,there is no man that can be saved; for there is none that hath not
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15378,transgressed the Law of God. And therefore when wee are said to be
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15379,"Justified by Works, it is to be understood of the Will, which God doth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15380,"alwaies accept for the Work it selfe, as well in good, as in evill men."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15381,"And in this sense onely it is, that a man is called Just, or Unjust; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15382,"that his Justice Justifies him, that is, gives him the title, in Gods"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15383,"acceptation, of Just; and renders him capable of Living By His Faith,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15384,"which before he was not. So that Justice Justifies in that that sense,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15385,"in which to Justifie, is the same that to Denominate A Man Just; and not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15386,in the signification of discharging the Law; whereby the punishment of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15387,his sins should be unjust.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15388,"But a man is then also said to be Justified, when his Plea, though in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15389,"it selfe unsufficient, is accepted; as when we Plead our Will, our"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15390,"Endeavour to fulfill the Law, and Repent us of our failings, and God"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15391,accepteth it for the Performance it selfe: And because God accepteth not
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15392,"the Will for the Deed, but onely in the Faithfull; it is therefore Faith"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15393,"that makes good our Plea; and in this sense it is, that Faith onely"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15394,Justifies: So that Faith and Obedience are both Necessary to Salvation;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15395,yet in severall senses each of them is said to Justifie.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15396,Obedience To God And To The Civill Soveraign Not Inconsistent
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15397,"Whether Christian, Having thus shewn what is Necessary to Salvation; it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,43,15398,is not hard to reconcile our Obedience to the Civill Soveraign; who is

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15501,"such justling of one another out of their places, both by forraign,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15502,and Civill war? such stumbling at every little asperity of their own

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15507,"The Enemy has been here in the Night of our naturall Ignorance, and sown"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15508,"the tares of Spirituall Errors; and that, First, by abusing, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15509,"putting out the light of the Scriptures: For we erre, not knowing the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15510,"Scriptures. Secondly, by introducing the Daemonology of the Heathen"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15511,"Poets, that is to say, their fabulous Doctrine concerning Daemons, which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15512,"are but Idols, or Phantasms of the braine, without any reall nature of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15513,"their own, distinct from humane fancy; such as are dead mens Ghosts, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15514,"Fairies, and other matter of old Wives tales. Thirdly, by mixing with"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15526,Of God
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15527,"The greatest, and main abuse of Scripture, and to which almost all the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15528,"rest are either consequent, or subservient, is the wresting of it, to"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15533,"who were therefore called his Peculiar People; and ceased afterward, in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15534,"the election of Saul, when they refused to be governed by God any more,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15535,and demanded a King after the manner of the nations; which God himself
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15536,"consented unto, as I have more at large proved before, in the 35."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15537,"Chapter. After that time, there was no other Kingdome of God in the"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15545,"happinesse of his Reign, on the same conditions of conversion and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15546,"repentance; and hee promised also to send his Son into the world, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15547,"expiate the sins of them all by his death, and to prepare them by his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15548,"Doctrine, to receive him at his second coming: Which second coming not"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15550,"under any other Kings by Pact, but our Civill Soveraigns; saving onely,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15551,"that Christian men are already in the Kingdome of Grace, in as much as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15552,they have already the Promise of being received at his comming againe.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15553,As That The Kingdome Of God Is The Present Church
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15554,"Consequent to this Errour, that the present Church is Christs Kingdome,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15555,"there ought to be some one Man, or Assembly, by whose mouth our Saviour"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15564,they have engaged their obedience.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15565,And That The Pope Is His Vicar Generall
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15566,Consequent to this claim of the Pope to Vicar Generall of Christ in the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15567,"present Church, (supposed to be that Kingdom of his, to which we are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15568,"addressed in the Gospel,) is the Doctrine, that it is necessary for a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15569,"Christian King, to receive his Crown by a Bishop; as if it were from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15570,"that Ceremony, that he derives the clause of Dei Gratia in his title;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15571,"and that then onely he is made King by the favour of God, when he is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15572,crowned by the authority of Gods universall Viceregent on earth; and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15573,"that every Bishop whosoever be his Soveraign, taketh at his Consecration"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15574,"an oath of absolute Obedience to the Pope, Consequent to the same, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15575,"the Doctrine of the fourth Councell of Lateran, held under Pope Innocent"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15576,"the third, (Chap. 3. De Haereticis.) ""That if a King at the Popes"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15579,"his Subjects are absolved of the bond of their obedience."" Where, by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15580,Haeresies are understood all opinions which the Church of Rome hath
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15581,"forbidden to be maintained. And by this means, as often as there is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15582,"any repugnancy between the Politicall designes of the Pope, and other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15583,"Christian Princes, as there is very often, there ariseth such a Mist"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15584,"amongst their Subjects, that they know not a stranger that thrusteth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15585,"himself into the throne of their lawfull Prince, from him whom they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15586,"had themselves placed there; and in this Darknesse of mind, are made to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15587,"fight one against another, without discerning their enemies from their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15588,"friends, under the conduct of another mans ambition."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15589,And That The Pastors Are The Clergy
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15590,"From the same opinion, that the present Church is the Kingdome of God,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15591,"it proceeds that Pastours, Deacons, and all other Ministers of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15592,"Church, take the name to themselves of the Clergy, giving to other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15593,"Christians the name of Laity, that is, simply People. For Clergy"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15594,"signifies those, whose maintenance is that Revenue, which God having"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15595,"reserved to himselfe during his Reigne over the Israelites, assigned"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15596,"to the tribe of Levi (who were to be his publique Ministers, and had no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15597,"portion of land set them out to live on, as their brethren) to be their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15598,"inheritance. The Pope therefore, (pretending the present Church to be,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15599,"as the Realme of Israel, the Kingdome of God) challenging to himselfe"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15600,"and his subordinate Ministers, the like revenue, as the Inheritance of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15601,"God, the name of Clergy was sutable to that claime. And thence it is,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15602,"that Tithes, or other tributes paid to the Levites, as Gods Right,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15603,"amongst the Israelites, have a long time been demanded, and taken of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15604,"Christians, by Ecclesiastiques, Jure Divino, that is, in Gods Right. By"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15605,"which meanes, the people every where were obliged to a double tribute;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15606,"one to the State, another to the Clergy; whereof, that to the Clergy,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15607,"being the tenth of their revenue, is double to that which a King of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15608,Athens (and esteemed a Tyrant) exacted of his subjects for the defraying
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15609,of all publique charges: For he demanded no more but the twentieth part;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15610,and yet abundantly maintained therewith the Commonwealth. And in the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15611,"Kingdome of the Jewes, during the Sacerdotall Reigne of God, the Tithes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15612,and Offerings were the whole Publique Revenue.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15613,"From the same mistaking of the present Church for the Kingdom of God,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15614,came in the distinction betweene the Civill and the Canon Laws: The
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15615,"civil Law being the acts of Soveraigns in their own Dominions, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15616,the Canon Law being the Acts of the Pope in the same Dominions. Which
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15617,"Canons, though they were but Canons, that is, Rules Propounded, and but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15618,"voluntarily received by Christian Princes, till the translation of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15619,"the Empire to Charlemain; yet afterwards, as the power of the Pope"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15620,"encreased, became Rules Commanded, and the Emperours themselves (to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15621,"avoyd greater mischiefes, which the people blinded might be led into)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15622,were forced to let them passe for Laws.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15623,"From hence it is, that in all Dominions, where the Popes Ecclesiasticall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15624,"power is entirely received, Jewes, Turkes, and Gentiles, are in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15625,"Roman Church tolerated in their Religion, as farre forth, as in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15626,exercise and profession thereof they offend not against the civill
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15627,"power: whereas in a Christian, though a stranger, not to be of the Roman"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15628,"Religion, is Capitall; because the Pope pretendeth that all Christians"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15629,are his Subjects. For otherwise it were as much against the law of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15630,"Nations, to persecute a Christian stranger, for professing the Religion"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15631,"of his owne country, as an Infidell; or rather more, in as much as they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15632,"that are not against Christ, are with him."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15633,"From the same it is, that in every Christian State there are certaine"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15634,"men, that are exempt, by Ecclesiasticall liberty, from the tributes, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15635,"from the tribunals of the Civil State; for so are the secular Clergy,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15636,"besides Monks and Friars, which in many places, bear so great a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15637,"proportion to the common people, as if need were, there might be raised"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15638,"out of them alone, an Army, sufficient for any warre the Church militant"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15639,"should imploy them in, against their owne, or other Princes."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15640,Error From Mistaking Consecration For Conjuration
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15641,"A second generall abuse of Scripture, is the turning of Consecration"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15642,"into Conjuration, or Enchantment. To Consecrate, is in Scripture, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15643,"Offer, Give, or Dedicate, in pious and decent language and gesture, a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15644,"man, or any other thing to God, by separating of it from common use;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15645,"that is to say, to Sanctifie, or make it Gods, and to be used only by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15646,"those, whom God hath appointed to be his Publike Ministers, (as I have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15647,"already proved at large in the 35. Chapter;) and thereby to change, not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15648,"the thing Consecrated, but onely the use of it, from being Profane"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15649,"and common, to be Holy, and peculiar to Gods service. But when by such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15650,"words, the nature of qualitie of the thing it selfe, is pretended to be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15651,"changed, it is not Consecration, but either an extraordinary worke of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15652,"God, or a vaine and impious Conjuration. But seeing (for the frequency"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15653,"of pretending the change of Nature in their Consecrations,) it cannot"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15654,"be esteemed a work extraordinary, it is no other than a Conjuration or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15655,"Incantation, whereby they would have men to beleeve an alteration of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15656,"Nature that is not, contrary to the testimony of mans Sight, and of all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15657,"the rest of his Senses. As for example, when the Priest, in stead of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15658,Consecrating Bread and Wine to Gods peculiar service in the Sacrament of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15659,"the Lords Supper, (which is but a separation of it from the common use,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15660,"to signifie, that is, to put men in mind of their Redemption, by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15661,"Passion of Christ, whose body was broken, and blood shed upon the Crosse"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15662,"for our transgressions,) pretends, that by saying of the words of our"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15663,"Saviour, ""This is my Body,"" and ""This is my Blood,"" the nature of Bread"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15664,"is no more there, but his very Body; notwithstanding there appeared not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15665,"to the Sight, or other Sense of the Receiver, any thing that appeareth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15666,"not before the Consecration. The Egyptian Conjurers, that are said"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15667,"to have turned their Rods to Serpents, and the Water into Bloud, are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15668,thought but to have deluded the senses of the Spectators by a false shew
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15669,"of things, yet are esteemed Enchanters: But what should wee have thought"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15670,"of them, if there had appeared in their Rods nothing like a Serpent, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15671,"in the Water enchanted, nothing like Bloud, nor like any thing else but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15672,"Water, but that they had faced down the King, that they were Serpents"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15673,"that looked like Rods, and that it was Bloud that seemed Water? That"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15674,"had been both Enchantment, and Lying. And yet in this daily act of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15675,"the Priest, they doe the very same, by turning the holy words into the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15676,"manner of a Charme, which produceth nothing now to the Sense; but they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15677,"face us down, that it hath turned the Bread into a Man; nay more, into"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15678,"a God; and require men to worship it, as if it were our Saviour himself"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15679,"present God and Man, and thereby to commit most grosse Idolatry. For if"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15680,"it bee enough to excuse it of Idolatry, to say it is no more Bread, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15681,"God; why should not the same excuse serve the Egyptians, in case they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15682,"had the faces to say, the Leeks, and Onyons they worshipped, were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15683,"not very Leeks, and Onyons, but a Divinity under their Species, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15684,"likenesse. The words, ""This is my Body,"" are aequivalent to these,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15685,"""This signifies, or represents my Body;"" and it is an ordinary figure of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15686,"Speech: but to take it literally, is an abuse; nor though so taken, can"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15687,"it extend any further, than to the Bread which Christ himself with his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15688,"own hands Consecrated. For hee never said, that of what Bread soever,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15689,"any Priest whatsoever, should say, ""This is my Body,"" or, ""This is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15690,"Christs Body,"" the same should presently be transubstantiated. Nor did"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15691,"the Church of Rome ever establish this Transubstantiation, till the time"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15692,"of Innocent the third; which was not above 500. years agoe, when the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15693,"Power of Popes was at the Highest, and the Darknesse of the time grown"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15694,"so great, as men discerned not the Bread that was given them to eat,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15695,especially when it was stamped with the figure of Christ upon the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15696,"Crosse, as if they would have men beleeve it were Transubstantiated, not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15697,"onely into the Body of Christ, but also into the Wood of his Crosse, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15698,that they did eat both together in the Sacrament.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15699,Incantation In The Ceremonies Of Baptisme
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15700,"The like incantation, in stead of Consecration, is used also in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15701,Sacrament of Baptisme: Where the abuse of Gods name in each severall

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15705,"God the Father Almighty, and in the name of Jesus Christ his onely Son"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15708,"supplant the Enemy, &c."" And the same in the Benediction of the Salt"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15709,"to be mingled with it; ""That thou become Conjured Salt, that all"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15813,"I have already answered them; and made it evident, that the Kingdome"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15814,"of God, instituted by Moses, ended in the election of Saul: After which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15815,time the Priest of his own authority never deposed any King. That which
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15816,"the High Priest did to Athaliah, was not done in his own right, but in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15817,the right of the young King Joash her Son: But Solomon in his own right
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15818,"deposed the High Priest Abiathar, and set up another in his place. The"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15819,"most difficult place to answer, of all those than can be brought,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15820,"to prove the Kingdome of God by Christ is already in this world, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15821,"alledged, not by Bellarmine, nor any other of the Church of Rome; but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15822,by Beza; that will have it to begin from the Resurrection of Christ.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15823,"But whether hee intend thereby, to entitle the Presbytery to the Supreme"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15829,"of Church government, no lesse then the Pope challengeth it universally."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15830,Answer To The Text On Which Beza Infereth
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15831,That The Kingdome Of Christ Began At The Resurrection The words are
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15832,"(Marke 9.1.) ""Verily, I say unto you, that there be some of them that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15833,"stand here, which shall not tast of death, till they have seene the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15834,"Kingdome of God come with power."" Which words, if taken grammatically,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15835,"make it certaine, that either some of those men that stood by Christ at"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15836,"that time, are yet alive; or else, that the Kingdome of God must be now"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15837,in this present world. And then there is another place more difficult:
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15838,"For when the Apostles after our Saviours Resurrection, and immediately"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15839,"before his Ascension, asked our Saviour, saying, (Acts.1.6.) ""Wilt thou"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15840,"at this time restore again the Kingdome to Israel,"" he answered them,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15841,"""It is not for you to know the times and the seasons, which the Father"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15842,hath put in his own power; But ye shall receive power by the comming of

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15846,"nor shall you foreknow when it shall come, for it shall come as a theefe"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15847,"in the night; But I will send you the Holy Ghost, and by him you shall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15848,have power to beare witnesse to all the world (by your preaching) of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15849,"my Resurrection, and the workes I have done, and the doctrine I have"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15851,comming againe: How does this agree with the comming of Christs Kingdome
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15852,"at the Resurrection? And that which St. Paul saies (1 Thessal. 1.9, 10.)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15853,"""That they turned from Idols, to serve the living and true God, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15854,"to waite for his Sonne from Heaven:"" Where to waite for his Sonne from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15855,"Heaven, is to wait for his comming to be King in power; which were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15856,"not necessary, if this Kingdome had beene then present. Againe, if the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15857,Kingdome of God began (as Beza on that place (Mark 9.1.) would have it)
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15858,at the Resurrection; what reason is there for Christians ever since the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15859,"Resurrection to say in their prayers, ""Let thy Kingdome Come""? It"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15860,"is therefore manifest, that the words of St. Mark are not so to be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15861,interpreted. There be some of them that stand here (saith our Saviour)
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15862,that shall not tast of death till they have seen the Kingdome of God
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15863,come in power. If then this Kingdome were to come at the Resurrection
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15864,"of Christ, why is it said, ""some of them"" rather than all? For they all"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15867,"But they that require an exact interpretation of this text, let them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15868,interpret first the like words of our Saviour to St. Peter concerning

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15870,"that to thee?"" upon which was grounded a report that hee should not dye:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15871,"Neverthelesse the truth of that report was neither confirmed, as well"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15872,"grounded; nor refuted, as ill grounded on those words; but left as a"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15875,"which immediately followes, both here, and in St. Luke, where the same"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15876,"is againe repeated, it is not unprobable, to say they have relation"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15877,"to the Transfiguration, which is described in the verses immediately"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15878,"following; where it is said, that ""After six dayes Jesus taketh with"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15879,"him Peter, and James, and John (not all, but some of his Disciples)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15880,"and leadeth them up into an high mountaine apart by themselves, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15881,"was transfigured before them. And his rayment became shining, exceeding"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15882,white as snow; so as no Fuller on earth can white them. And there
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15883,"appeared unto them Elias with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15884,"&c."" So that they saw Christ in Glory and Majestie, as he is to come;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15885,"insomuch as ""They were sore afraid."" And thus the promise of our Saviour"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15886,"was accomplished by way of Vision: For it was a Vision, as may probably"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15887,"bee inferred out of St. Luke, that reciteth the same story (ch. 9. ve."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15888,"28.) and saith, that Peter and they that were with him, were heavy with"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15889,sleep; But most certainly out of Matth. 17.9. (where the same is again
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15890,"related;) for our Saviour charged them, saying, ""Tell no man the Vision"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15891,"untill the Son of man be Risen from the dead."" Howsoever it be, yet"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15892,"there can from thence be taken no argument, to prove that the Kingdome"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15896,Soveraignes (besides those of Bellarmine;) as that the two Swords that

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15901,"Bible, that by Heaven is meant the Pope, and by Earth the King: Which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15902,"is not arguing from Scripture, but a wanton insulting over Princes, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15903,came in fashion after the time the Popes were growne so secure of their

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15909,"As for the rites of Consecration, though they depend for the most part"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15910,"upon the discretion and judgement of the governors of the Church,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15911,and not upon the Scriptures; yet those governors are obliged to such

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15914,"least conformable to the action. When Moses consecrated the Tabernacle,"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,15928,"the grace to accomplish the same; and then prayed unto him, first,"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16082,"Upon this Doctrine of the Naturall Eternity of separated Soules, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16083,founded (as I said) the Doctrine of Purgatory. For supposing Eternall

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16087,"first, the Fasting of David for Saul and Jonathan, mentioned (2 Kings,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16088,"1. 12.); and againe, (2 Sam. 3. 35.) for the death of Abner. This"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16089,"Fasting of David, he saith, was for the obtaining of something for them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16090,"at Gods hands, after their death; because after he had Fasted to procure"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16092,called for meate. Seeing then the Soule hath an existence separate from
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16093,"the Body, and nothing can be obtained by mens Fasting for the Soules"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16094,"that are already either in Heaven, or Hell, it followeth that there be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16095,"some Soules of dead men, what are neither in Heaven, nor in Hell; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16096,"therefore they must bee in some third place, which must be Purgatory."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16097,"And thus with hard straining, hee has wrested those places to the proofe"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16098,"of a Purgatory; whereas it is manifest, that the ceremonies of Mourning,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16099,"and Fasting, when they are used for the death of men, whose life was"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16100,"not profitable to the Mourners, they are used for honours sake to their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16101,persons; and when tis done for the death of them by whose life the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16102,"Mourners had benefit, it proceeds from their particular dammage: And so"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16103,"David honoured Saul, and Abner, with his Fasting; and in the death of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16104,"his owne child, recomforted himselfe, by receiving his ordinary food."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16105,"In the other places, which he alledgeth out of the old Testament, there"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16130,"shall bee from the day of Judgement forward, everlasting, which is"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16132,"be no Purgatory; And therefore the World to come, and Purgatory, are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16133,inconsistent. But what then can bee the meaning of those our Saviours
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16134,words? I confesse they are very hardly to bee reconciled with all the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16135,"Doctrines now unanimously received: Nor is it any shame, to confesse the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16136,"profoundnesse of the Scripture, to bee too great to be sounded by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16137,"shortnesse of humane understanding. Neverthelesse, I may propound such"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16138,"things to the consideration of more learned Divines, as the text it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16139,"selfe suggesteth. And first, seeing to speake against the Holy Ghost, as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16140,"being the third Person of the Trinity, is to speake against the Church,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16141,"in which the Holy Ghost resideth; it seemeth the comparison is made,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16142,"betweene the Easinesse of our Saviour, in bearing with offences done to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16143,"him while he was on earth, and the Severity of the Pastors after him,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16144,"against those which should deny their authority, which was from the Holy"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16145,"Ghost: As if he should say, You that deny my Power; nay you that shall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16146,"crucifie me, shall be pardoned by mee, as often as you turne unto mee by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16147,"Repentance: But if you deny the Power of them that teach you hereafter,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16148,"by vertue of the Holy Ghost, they shall be inexorable, and shall not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16149,"forgive you, but persecute you in this World, and leave you without"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16150,"absolution, (though you turn to me, unlesse you turn also to them,) to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16151,the punishments (as much as lies in them) of the World to come: And
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16152,"so the words may be taken as a Prophecy, or Praediction concerning the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16153,"times, as they have along been in the Christian Church: Or if this be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16154,"not the meaning, (for I am not peremptory in such difficult places,)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16155,perhaps there may be place left after the Resurrection for the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16156,"Repentance of some sinners: And there is also another place, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16157,seemeth to agree therewith. For considering the words of St. Paul (1
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16158,"Cor. 15. 29.) ""What shall they doe which are Baptized for the dead, if"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16159,"the dead rise not at all? why also are they Baptized for the dead?"" a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16160,"man may probably inferre, as some have done, that in St. Pauls time,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16161,"there was a custome by receiving Baptisme for the dead, (as men that now"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16162,"beleeve, are Sureties and Undertakers for the Faith of Infants, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16163,"are not capable of beleeving,) to undertake for the persons of their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16164,"deceased friends, that they should be ready to obey, and receive our"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16165,"Saviour for their King, at his coming again; and then the forgivenesse"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16166,"of sins in the world to come, has no need of a Purgatory. But in both"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16167,"these interpretations, there is so much of paradox, that I trust not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16168,to them; but propound them to those that are throughly versed in the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16169,"Scripture, to inquire if there be no clearer place that contradicts"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16170,"them. Onely of thus much, I see evident Scripture, to perswade men, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16171,"there is neither the word, nor the thing of Purgatory, neither in this,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16172,nor any other text; nor any thing that can prove a necessity of a place
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16173,for the Soule without the Body; neither for the Soule of Lazarus during
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16174,the four days he was dead; nor for the Soules of them which the Romane
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16175,"Church pretend to be tormented now in Purgatory. For God, that could"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16176,"give a life to a peece of clay, hath the same power to give life again"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16177,"to a dead man, and renew his inanimate, and rotten Carkasse, into a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16178,"glorious, spirituall, and immortall Body."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16179,Another place is that of 1 Cor. 3. where it is said that they which
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16180,"built Stubble, Hay, &c. on the true Foundation, their work shall perish;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16181,"but ""they themselves shall be saved; but as through Fire:"" This Fire, he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16182,"will have to be the Fire of Purgatory. The words, as I have said before,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16183,"are an allusion to those of Zach. 13. 9. where he saith, ""I will bring"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16184,"the third part through the Fire, and refine them as Silver is refined,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16185,"and will try them as Gold is tryed;"" Which is spoken of the comming of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16186,"the Messiah in Power and Glory; that is, at the day of Judgment, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16187,Conflagration of the present world; wherein the Elect shall not be
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16188,"consumed, but be refined; that is, depose their erroneous Doctrines, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16189,"Traditions, and have them as it were sindged off; and shall afterwards"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16190,"call upon the name of the true God. In like manner, the Apostle saith"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16191,"of them, that holding this Foundation Jesus Is The Christ, shall build"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16192,"thereon some other Doctrines that be erroneous, that they shall not be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16193,"consumed in that fire which reneweth the world, but shall passe through"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16194,"it to Salvation; but so, as to see, and relinquish their former Errours."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16195,"The Builders, are the Pastors; the Foundation, that Jesus Is The Christ;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16196,"the Stubble and Hay, False Consequences Drawn From It Through Ignorance,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16197,"Or Frailty; the Gold, Silver, and pretious Stones, are their True"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16198,"Doctrines; and their Refining or Purging, the Relinquishing Of Their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16199,Errors. In all which there is no colour at all for the burning of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16200,"Incorporeall, that is to say, Impatible Souls."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16201,"Baptisme For The Dead, How Understood"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16202,"A third place is that of 1 Cor. 15. before mentioned, concerning"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16203,"Baptisme for the Dead: out of which he concludeth, first, that Prayers"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16204,"for the Dead are not unprofitable; and out of that, that there is a Fire"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16205,of Purgatory: But neither of them rightly. For of many interpretations
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16206,"of the word Baptisme, he approveth this in the first place, that by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16207,Baptisme is meant (metaphorically) a Baptisme of Penance; and that men
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16208,"are in this sense Baptized, when they Fast, and Pray, and give Almes:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16209,"And so Baptisme for the Dead, and Prayer of the Dead, is the same thing."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16210,"But this is a Metaphor, of which there is no example, neither in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16211,"the Scripture, nor in any other use of language; and which is also"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16212,"discordant to the harmony, and scope of the Scripture. The word Baptisme"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16213,is used (Mar. 10. 38. & Luk. 12. 59.) for being Dipped in ones own
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16214,"bloud, as Christ was upon the Cross, and as most of the Apostles"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16215,"were, for giving testimony of him. But it is hard to say, that Prayer,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16216,"Fasting, and Almes, have any similitude with Dipping. The same is used"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16217,also Mat. 3. 11. (which seemeth to make somewhat for Purgatory) for
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16218,a Purging with Fire. But it is evident the Fire and Purging here
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16219,"mentioned, is the same whereof the Prophet Zachary speaketh (chap. 13."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16220,"v. 9.) ""I will bring the third part through the Fire, and will Refine"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16221,"them, &c."" And St. Peter after him (1 Epist. 1. 7.) ""That the triall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16222,"of your Faith, which is much more precious than of Gold that perisheth,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16223,"though it be tryed with fire, might be found unto praise, and honour,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16224,"and glory at the Appearing of Jesus Christ;"" And St. Paul (1 Cor. 3."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16225,"13.) The Fire shall trie every mans work of what sort it is."" But"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16226,"St. Peter, and St. Paul speak of the Fire that shall be at the Second"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16227,Appearing of Christ; and the Prophet Zachary of the Day of Judgment: And
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16228,therefore this place of S. Mat. may be interpreted of the same; and then
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16229,there will be no necessity of the Fire of Purgatory.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16230,"Another interpretation of Baptisme for the Dead, is that which I"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16231,"have before mentioned, which he preferreth to the second place of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16232,probability; And thence also he inferreth the utility of Prayer for the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16233,"Dead. For if after the Resurrection, such as have not heard of Christ,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16234,"or not beleeved in him, may be received into Christs Kingdome; it is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16235,"not in vain, after their death, that their friends should pray for them,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16236,"till they should be risen. But granting that God, at the prayers of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16237,"faithfull, may convert unto him some of those that have not heard Christ"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16238,"preached, and consequently cannot have rejected Christ, and that the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16239,"charity of men in that point, cannot be blamed; yet this concludeth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16240,"nothing for Purgatory, because to rise from Death to Life, is one thing;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16241,to rise from Purgatory to Life is another; and being a rising from Life
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16242,"to Life, from a Life in torments to a Life in joy."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16243,"A fourth place is that of Mat. 5. 25. ""Agree with thine Adversary"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16244,"quickly, whilest thou art in the way with him, lest at any time the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16245,"Adversary deliver thee to the Officer, and thou be cast into prison."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16246,"Verily I say unto thee, thou shalt by no means come out thence, till"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16247,"thou has paid the uttermost farthing."" In which Allegory, the Offender"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16248,is the Sinner; both the Adversary and the Judge is God; the Way is
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16249,"this Life; the Prison is the Grave; the Officer, Death; from which, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16250,"sinner shall not rise again to life eternall, but to a second Death,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16251,"till he have paid the utmost farthing, or Christ pay it for him by his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16252,"Passion, which is a full Ransome for all manner of sin, as well lesser"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16253,"sins, as greater crimes; both being made by the passion of Christ"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16254,equally veniall.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16255,"The fift place, is that of Matth. 5. 22. ""Whosoever is angry with his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16256,"Brother without a cause, shall be guilty in Judgment. And whosoever"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16257,"shall say to his Brother, RACHA, shall be guilty in the Councel. But"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16258,"whosoever shall say, Thou Foole, shall be guilty to hell fire."" From"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16259,"which words he inferreth three sorts of Sins, and three sorts of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16260,"Punishments; and that none of those sins, but the last, shall be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16261,"punished with hell fire; and consequently, that after this life, there"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16262,"is punishment of lesser sins in Purgatory. Of which inference, there is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16263,no colour in any interpretation that hath yet been given to them: Shall
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16264,"there be a distinction after this life of Courts of Justice, as there"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16265,"was amongst the Jews in our Saviours time, to hear, and determine"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16266,"divers sorts of Crimes; as the Judges, and the Councell? Shall not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16267,"all Judicature appertain to Christ, and his Apostles? To understand"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16268,"therefore this text, we are not to consider it solitarily, but jointly"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16269,"with the words precedent, and subsequent. Our Saviour in this Chapter"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16270,interpreteth the Law of Moses; which the Jews thought was then
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16271,"fulfilled, when they had not transgressed the Grammaticall sense"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16272,"thereof, howsoever they had transgressed against the sentence, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16273,meaning of the Legislator. Therefore whereas they thought the Sixth
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16274,"Commandement was not broken, but by Killing a man; nor the Seventh, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16275,"when a man lay with a woman, not his wife; our Saviour tells them, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16276,"inward Anger of a man against his brother, if it be without just cause,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16277,"is Homicide: You have heard (saith hee) the Law of Moses, ""Thou shalt"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16278,"not Kill,"" and that ""Whosoever shall Kill, shall be condemned before the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16279,"Judges,"" or before the Session of the Seventy: But I say unto you, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16280,"be Angry with ones Brother without cause; or to say unto him Racha, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16281,"Foole, is Homicide, and shall be punished at the day of Judgment, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16282,"Session of Christ, and his Apostles, with Hell fire: so that those words"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16283,"were not used to distinguish between divers Crimes, and divers Courts"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16284,"of Justice, and divers Punishments; but to taxe the distinction between"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16285,"sin, and sin, which the Jews drew not from the difference of the Will"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16286,"in Obeying God, but from the difference of their Temporall Courts of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16287,"Justice; and to shew them that he that had the Will to hurt his Brother,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16288,"though the effect appear but in Reviling, or not at all, shall be cast"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16289,"into hell fire, by the Judges, and by the Session, which shall be the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16290,"same, not different Courts at the day of Judgment. This Considered, what"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16291,"can be drawn from this text, to maintain Purgatory, I cannot imagine."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,44,16292,"The sixth place is Luke 16. 9. ""Make yee friends of the unrighteous"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16363,Chapter of this discourse.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16364,How That Doctrine Was Spread
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16365,"The Graecians, by their Colonies and Conquests, communicated their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16366,"Language and Writings into Asia, Egypt, and Italy; and therein, by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16367,"necessary consequence their Daemonology, or (as St. Paul calles it)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16368,"""their Doctrines of Devils;"" And by that meanes, the contagion was"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16369,"derived also to the Jewes, both of Judaea, and Alexandria, and other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16370,"parts, whereinto they were dispersed. But the name of Daemon they did"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16371,"not (as the Graecians) attribute to Spirits both Good, and Evill; but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16372,to the Evill onely: And to the Good Daemons they gave the name of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16373,Spirit of God; and esteemed those into whose bodies they entred to be
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16374,"Prophets. In summe, all singularity if Good, they attributed to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16375,"Spirit of God; and if Evill, to some Daemon, but a kakodaimen, an Evill"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16376,"Daemon, that is, a Devill. And therefore, they called Daemoniaques, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16377,"is, possessed by the Devill, such as we call Madmen or Lunatiques; or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16378,"such as had the Falling Sicknesse; or that spoke any thing, which they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16379,"for want of understanding, thought absurd: As also of an Unclean person"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16380,"in a notorious degree, they used to say he had an Unclean Spirit; of a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16381,"Dumbe man, that he had a Dumbe Devill; and of John Baptist (Math. 11."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16382,"18.) for the singularity of his fasting, that he had a Devill; and of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16383,"our Saviour, because he said, hee that keepeth his sayings should not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16384,"see Death In Aeternum, (John 8. 52.) ""Now we know thou hast a Devill;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16385,"Abraham is dead, and the Prophets are dead:"" And again, because he said"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16386,"(John 7. 20.) ""They went about to kill him,"" the people answered, ""Thou"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16387,"hast a Devill, who goeth about to kill thee?"" Whereby it is manifest,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16388,"that the Jewes had the same opinions concerning Phantasmes, namely, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16389,"they were not Phantasmes that is, Idols of the braine, but things reall,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16390,and independent on the Fancy.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16391,Why Our Saviour Controlled It Not
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16392,"Which doctrine if it be not true, why (may some say) did not our Saviour"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16393,"contradict it, and teach the Contrary? nay why does he use on diverse"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16394,"occasions, such forms of speech as seem to confirm it? To this I answer,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16395,"that first, where Christ saith, ""A Spirit hath not flesh and bone,"""
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16396,"though hee shew that there be Spirits, yet he denies not that they are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16397,"Bodies: And where St. Paul sais, ""We shall rise Spirituall Bodies,"" he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16398,"acknowledgeth the nature of Spirits, but that they are Bodily Spirits;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16399,which is not difficult to understand. For Air and many other things
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16400,"are Bodies, though not Flesh and Bone, or any other grosse body, to bee"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16401,"discerned by the eye. But when our Saviour speaketh to the Devill, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16402,"commandeth him to go out of a man, if by the Devill, be meant a Disease,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16403,"as Phrenesy, or Lunacy, or a corporeal Spirit, is not the speech"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16404,improper? can Diseases heare? or can there be a corporeall Spirit in a
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16405,"Body of Flesh and Bone, full already of vitall and animall Spirits?"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16406,"Are there not therefore Spirits, that neither have Bodies, nor are meer"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16407,"Imaginations? To the first I answer, that the addressing of our Saviours"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16408,"command to the Madnesse, or Lunacy he cureth, is no more improper, then"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16409,"was his rebuking of the Fever, or of the Wind, and Sea; for neither"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16410,"do these hear: Or than was the command of God, to the Light, to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16411,"Firmament, to the Sunne, and Starres, when he commanded them to bee; for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16412,they could not heare before they had a beeing. But those speeches are
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16413,"not improper, because they signifie the power of Gods Word: no more"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16414,"therefore is it improper, to command Madnesse, or Lunacy (under the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16415,"appellation of Devils, by which they were then commonly understood,)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16416,"to depart out of a mans body. To the second, concerning their being"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16417,"Incorporeall, I have not yet observed any place of Scripture, from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16418,"whence it can be gathered, that any man was ever possessed with any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16419,"other Corporeal Spirit, but that of his owne, by which his body is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16420,naturally moved.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16421,The Scriptures Doe Not Teach That Spirits Are Incorporeall
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16422,"Our Saviour, immediately after the Holy Ghost descended upon him in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16423,"form of a Dove, is said by St. Matthew (Chapt. 4. 1.) to have been ""led"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16424,"up by the Spirit into the Wildernesse;"" and the same is recited (Luke 4."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16425,"1.) in these words, ""Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost, was led in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16426,"the Spirit into the Wildernesse;"" Whereby it is evident, that by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16427,"Spirit there, is meant the Holy Ghost. This cannot be interpreted for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16428,"a Possession: For Christ, and the Holy Ghost, are but one and the same"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16429,"substance; which is no possession of one substance, or body, by another."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16430,"And whereas in the verses following, he is said ""to have been taken"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16431,"up by the Devill into the Holy City, and set upon a pinnacle of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16432,"Temple,"" shall we conclude thence that hee was possessed of the Devill,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16433,"or carryed thither by violence? And again, ""carryed thence by the Devill"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16434,"into an exceeding high mountain, who shewed him them thence all the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16435,"Kingdomes of the world:"" herein, wee are not to beleeve he was either"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16436,"possessed, or forced by the Devill; nor that any Mountaine is high"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16437,"enough, (according to the literall sense,) to shew him one whole"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16438,"Hemisphere. What then can be the meaning of this place, other than that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16439,he went of himself into the Wildernesse; and that this carrying of him
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16440,"up and down, from the Wildernesse to the City, and from thence into a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16441,"Mountain, was a Vision? Conformable whereunto, is also the phrase of St."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16442,"Luke, that hee was led into the Wildernesse, not By, but In the Spirit:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16443,"whereas concerning His being Taken up into the Mountaine, and unto the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16444,"Pinnacle of the Temple, hee speaketh as St. Matthew doth. Which suiteth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16445,with the nature of a Vision.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16446,"Again, where St. Luke sayes of Judas Iscariot, that ""Satan entred into"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16448,"Captaines, how he might betray Christ unto them:"" it may be answered,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16449,"that by the Entring of Satan (that is the Enemy) into him, is meant, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16450,hostile and traiterous intention of selling his Lord and Master. For as
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16451,"by the Holy Ghost, is frequently in Scripture understood, the Graces and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16452,good Inclinations given by the Holy Ghost; so by the Entring of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16453,"Satan, may bee understood the wicked Cogitations, and Designes of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16454,"Adversaries of Christ, and his Disciples. For as it is hard to say,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16455,"that the Devill was entred into Judas, before he had any such hostile"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16456,"designe; so it is impertinent to say, he was first Christs Enemy in his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16457,"heart, and that the Devill entred into him afterwards. Therefore the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16458,"Entring of Satan, and his Wicked Purpose, was one and the same thing."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16459,"But if there be no Immateriall Spirit, nor any Possession of mens bodies"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16460,"by any Spirit Corporeall, it may again be asked, why our Saviour and his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16461,"Apostles did not teach the People so; and in such cleer words, as they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16462,"might no more doubt thereof. But such questions as these, are more"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16463,"curious, than necessary for a Christian mans Salvation. Men may as well"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16464,"aske, why Christ that could have given to all men Faith, Piety, and all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16465,"manner of morall Vertues, gave it to some onely, and not to all: and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16466,"why he left the search of naturall Causes, and Sciences, to the naturall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16467,"Reason and Industry of men, and did not reveal it to all, or any man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16468,supernaturally; and many other such questions: Of which neverthelesse
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16469,"there may be alledged probable and pious reasons. For as God, when he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16470,"brought the Israelites into the Land of Promise, did not secure them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16471,"therein, by subduing all the Nations round about them; but left many of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16472,"them, as thornes in their sides, to awaken from time to time their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16473,"Piety and Industry: so our Saviour, in conducting us toward his heavenly"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16474,"Kingdome, did not destroy all the difficulties of Naturall Questions;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16475,"but left them to exercise our Industry, and Reason; the Scope of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16476,"his preaching, being onely to shew us this plain and direct way to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16477,"Salvation, namely, the beleef of this Article, ""that he was the Christ,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16478,"the Son of the living God, sent into the world to sacrifice himselfe for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16479,"our Sins, and at his comming again, gloriously to reign over his Elect,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16480,"and to save them from their Enemies eternally:"" To which, the opinion"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16482,"though it be to some an occasion of going out of the way, and to follow"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16483,their own Inventions. If wee require of the Scripture an account of all
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16484,"questions, which may be raised to trouble us in the performance of Gods"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16485,commands; we may as well complaine of Moses for not having set downe the

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16487,"Earth, and Sea, and of Men, and Beasts. To conclude, I find in Scripture"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16491,"find that there are Spirits Corporeal, (though subtile and Invisible;)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16492,"but not that any mans body was possessed, or inhabited by them; And that"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16503,"these times we hear of, and see many Mad-men, and few Daemoniaques,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16504,proceeds not from the change of Nature; but of Names. But how it comes
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16505,"to passe, that whereas heretofore the Apostles, and after them for a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16506,"time, the Pastors of the Church, did cure those singular Diseases, which"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16509,"to say, as we read (Mark 16. 17.) ""In Christs name to cast out Devills,"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16513,"is another question. And it is probable, that those extraordinary gifts"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16514,"were given to the Church, for no longer a time, than men trusted wholly"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16515,"to Christ, and looked for their felicity onely in his Kingdome to come;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16516,"and consequently, that when they sought Authority, and Riches, and"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16546,"for Gods, ALIENOS DEOS, that is, the Gods of other nations, but that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16547,"onely true God, who vouchsafed to commune with Moses, and by him to give"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16548,"them laws and directions, for their peace, and for their salvation"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16549,"from their enemies."" And the second was, that ""they should not make to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16550,"themselves any Image to Worship, of their own Invention."" For it is the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16551,"same deposing of a King, to submit to another King, whether he be set up"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16552,"by a neighbour nation, or by our selves."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16553,Answer To Certain Seeming Texts For Images
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16554,The places of Scripture pretended to countenance the setting up of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16555,"Images, to worship them; or to set them up at all in the places where"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16556,"God is worshipped, are First, two Examples; one of the Cherubins over"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16557,"the Ark of God; the other of the Brazen Serpent: Secondly, some texts"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16558,whereby we are commanded to worship certain Creatures for their relation
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16559,"to God; as to worship his Footstool: And lastly, some other texts, by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16560,"which is authorized, a religious honoring of Holy things. But before I"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16561,"examine the force of those places, to prove that which is pretended, I"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16562,"must first explain what is to be understood by Worshipping, and what by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16563,"Images, and Idols."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16564,What Is Worship
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16565,"I have already shewn in the 20 Chapter of this Discourse, that to Honor,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16566,is to value highly the Power of any person: and that such value is
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16567,"measured, by our comparing him with others. But because there is nothing"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16568,to be compared with God in Power; we Honor him not but Dishonour him
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16569,by any Value lesse than Infinite. And thus Honor is properly of its own
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16570,"nature, secret, and internall in the heart. But the inward thoughts of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16571,"men, which appeare outwardly in their words and actions, are the signes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16572,"of our Honoring, and these goe by the name of WORSHIP, in Latine,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16573,"CULTUS. Therefore, to Pray to, to Swear by, to Obey, to bee Diligent,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16574,"and Officious in Serving: in summe, all words and actions that betoken"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16575,"Fear to Offend, or Desire to Please, is Worship, whether those words"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16576,"and actions be sincere, or feigned: and because they appear as signes of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16577,"Honoring, are ordinarily also called Honor."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16578,Distinction Between Divine And Civill Worship
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16579,"The Worship we exhibite to those we esteem to be but men, as to Kings,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16580,"and men in Authority, is Civill Worship: But the worship we exhibite"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16581,"to that which we think to bee God, whatsoever the words, ceremonies,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16582,"gestures, or other actions be, is Divine Worship. To fall prostrate"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16583,"before a King, in him that thinks him but a Man, is but Civill Worship:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16584,"And he that but putteth off his hat in the Church, for this cause, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16585,"he thinketh it the House of God, worshippeth with Divine Worship. They"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16586,"that seek the distinction of Divine and Civill Worship, not in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16587,"intention of the Worshipper, but in the Words douleia, and latreia,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16588,deceive themselves. For whereas there be two sorts of Servants; that
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16589,"sort, which is of those that are absolutely in the power of their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16590,"Masters, as Slaves taken in war, and their Issue, whose bodies are not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16591,"in their own power, (their lives depending on the Will of their Masters,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16592,"in such manner as to forfeit them upon the least disobedience,) and that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16593,"are bought and sold as Beasts, were called Douloi, that is properly,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16594,"Slaves, and their Service, Douleia: The other, which is of those that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16595,"serve (for hire, or in hope of benefit from their Masters) voluntarily;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16596,"are called Thetes; that is, Domestique Servants; to whose service the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16597,"Masters have no further right, than is contained in the Covenants made"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16598,betwixt them. These two kinds of Servants have thus much common to them
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16599,"both, that their labour is appointed them by another, whether, as a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16600,"Slave, or a voluntary Servant: And the word Latris, is the general name"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16601,"of both, signifying him that worketh for another, whether, as a Slave,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16602,or a voluntary Servant: So that Latreia signifieth generally all
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16603,"Service; but Douleia the service of Bondmen onely, and the condition of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16604,Slavery: And both are used in Scripture (to signifie our Service of God)
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16605,"promiscuously. Douleia, because we are Gods Slaves; Latreia, because"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16606,"wee Serve him: and in all kinds of Service is contained, not onely"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16607,"Obedience, but also Worship, that is, such actions, gestures, and words,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16608,as signifie Honor.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16609,An Image What Phantasmes
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16610,An IMAGE (in the most strict signification of the word) is the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16611,Resemblance of some thing visible: In which sense the Phantasticall
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16612,"Formes, Apparitions, or Seemings of Visible Bodies to the Sight, are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16613,"onely Images; such as are the Shew of a man, or other thing in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16614,"Water, by Reflexion, or Refraction; or of the Sun, or Stars by Direct"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16615,"Vision in the Air; which are nothing reall in the things seen, nor in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16616,the place where thy seem to bee; nor are their magnitudes and figures
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16617,"the same with that of the object; but changeable, by the variation of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16618,"the organs of Sight, or by glasses; and are present oftentimes in our"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16619,"Imagination, and in our Dreams, when the object is absent; or changed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16620,"into other colours, and shapes, as things that depend onely upon the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16621,Fancy. And these are the Images which are originally and most properly
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16622,"called Ideas, and IDOLS, and derived from the language of the Graecians,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16623,with whom the word Eido signifieth to See. They are also called
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16624,"PHANTASMES, which is in the same language, Apparitions. And from these"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16625,"Images it is that one of the faculties of mans Nature, is called the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16626,"Imagination. And from hence it is manifest, that there neither is, nor"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16627,can bee any Image made of a thing Invisible.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16628,"It is also evident, that there can be no Image of a thing Infinite: for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16629,"all the Images, and Phantasmes that are made by the Impression of things"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16630,"visible, are figured: but Figure is a quantity every way determined: And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16631,therefore there can bee no Image of God: nor of the Soule of Man; nor of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16632,"Spirits, but onely of Bodies Visible, that is, Bodies that have light in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16633,"themselves, or are by such enlightened."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16634,Fictions; Materiall Images
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16635,And whereas a man can fancy Shapes he never saw; making up a Figure out
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16636,"of the parts of divers creatures; as the Poets make their Centaures,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16637,"Chimaeras, and other Monsters never seen: So can he also give Matter to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16638,"those Shapes, and make them in Wood, Clay or Metall. And these are also"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16639,"called Images, not for the resemblance of any corporeall thing, but for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16640,the resemblance of some Phantasticall Inhabitants of the Brain of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16641,"Maker. But in these Idols, as they are originally in the Brain, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16642,"as they are painted, carved, moulded, or moulten in matter, there is a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16643,"similitude of the one to the other, for which the Materiall Body made"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16644,"by Art, may be said to be the Image of the Phantasticall Idoll made by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16645,Nature.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16646,"But in a larger use of the word Image, is contained also, any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16647,Representation of one thing by another. So an earthly Soveraign may be
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16648,called the Image of God: And an inferiour Magistrate the Image of an
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16649,earthly Soveraign. And many times in the Idolatry of the Gentiles there
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16650,was little regard to the similitude of their Materiall Idoll to the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16651,"Idol in their fancy, and yet it was called the Image of it. For a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16652,"Stone unhewn has been set up for Neptune, and divers other shapes far"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16653,different from the shapes they conceived of their Gods. And at this
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16654,"day we see many Images of the Virgin Mary, and other Saints, unlike one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16655,"another, and without correspondence to any one mans Fancy; and yet serve"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16656,well enough for the purpose they were erected for; which was no more but
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16657,"by the Names onely, to represent the Persons mentioned in the History;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16658,"to which every man applyeth a Mentall Image of his owne making, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16659,"none at all. And thus an Image in the largest sense, is either the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16660,"Resemblance, or the Representation of some thing Visible; or both"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16661,"together, as it happeneth for the most part."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16662,"But the name of Idoll is extended yet further in Scripture, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16663,"signifie also the Sunne, or a Starre, or any other Creature, visible or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16664,"invisible, when they are worshipped for Gods."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16665,Idolatry What
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16666,"Having shewn what is Worship, and what an Image; I will now put them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16667,"together, and examine what that IDOLATRY is, which is forbidden in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16668,"Second Commandement, and other places of the Scripture."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16669,"To worship an Image, is voluntarily to doe those externall acts, which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16670,"are signes of honoring either the matter of the Image, which is Wood,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16671,"Stone, or Metall, or some other visible creature; or the Phantasme of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16672,"the brain, for the resemblance, or representation whereof, the matter"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16673,"was formed and figured; or both together, as one animate Body, composed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16674,"of the Matter and the Phantasme, as of a Body and Soule."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16675,"To be uncovered, before a man of Power and Authority, or before the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16676,"Throne of a Prince, or in such other places as hee ordaineth to that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16677,"purpose in his absence, is to Worship that man, or Prince with Civill"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16678,"Worship; as being a signe, not of honoring the stoole, or place, but the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16679,"Person; and is not Idolatry. But if hee that doth it, should suppose the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16680,"Soule of the Prince to be in the Stool, or should present a Petition to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16681,"the Stool, it were Divine Worship, and Idolatry."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16682,"To pray to a King for such things, as hee is able to doe for us, though"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16683,"we prostrate our selves before him, is but Civill Worship; because we"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16684,"acknowledge no other power in him, but humane: But voluntarily to pray"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16685,"unto him for fair weather, or for any thing which God onely can doe"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16686,"for us, is Divine Worship, and Idolatry. On the other side, if a King"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16687,"compell a man to it by the terrour of Death, or other great corporall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16688,"punishment, it is not Idolatry: For the Worship which the Soveraign"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16689,"commandeth to bee done unto himself by the terrour of his Laws, is not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16690,"a sign that he that obeyeth him, does inwardly honour him as a God, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16691,"that he is desirous to save himselfe from death, or from a miserable"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16692,"life; and that which is not a sign of internall honor, is no Worship;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16693,"and therefore no Idolatry. Neither can it bee said, that hee that does"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16694,"it, scandalizeth, or layeth any stumbling block before his Brother;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16695,"because how wise, or learned soever he be that worshippeth in that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16696,"manner, another man cannot from thence argue, that he approveth it; but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16697,"that he doth it for fear; and that it is not his act, but the act of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16698,Soveraign.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16699,"To worship God, in some peculiar Place, or turning a mans face towards"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16700,"an Image, or determinate Place, is not to worship, or honor the Place,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16701,"or Image; but to acknowledge it Holy, that is to say, to acknowledge"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16702,"the Image, or the Place to be set apart from common use: for that is the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16703,"meaning of the word Holy; which implies no new quality in the Place, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16704,Image; but onely a new Relation by Appropriation to God; and therefore
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16705,is not Idolatry; no more than it was Idolatry to worship God before
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16706,the Brazen Serpent; or for the Jews when they were out of their owne
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16707,"countrey, to turn their faces (when they prayed) toward the Temple of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16708,Jerusalem; or for Moses to put off his Shoes when he was before the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16709,"Flaming Bush, the ground appertaining to Mount Sinai; which place God"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16710,"had chosen to appear in, and to give his Laws to the People of Israel,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16711,"and was therefore Holy ground, not by inhaerent sanctity, but by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16712,"separation to Gods use; or for Christians to worship in the Churches,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16713,"which are once solemnly dedicated to God for that purpose, by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16714,"Authority of the King, or other true Representant of the Church. But to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16715,"worship God, is inanimating, or inhibiting, such Image, or place; that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16716,"is to say, an infinite substance in a finite place, is Idolatry: for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16717,"such finite Gods, are but Idols of the brain, nothing reall; and are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16718,"commonly called in the Scripture by the names of Vanity, and Lyes, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16719,"Nothing. Also to worship God, not as inanimating, or present in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16720,"place, or Image; but to the end to be put in mind of him, or of some"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16721,"works of his, in case the Place, or Image be dedicated, or set up"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16722,"by private authority, and not by the authority of them that are our"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16723,"Soveraign Pastors, is Idolatry. For the Commandement is, ""Thou shalt not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16724,"make to thy selfe any graven image."" God commanded Moses to set up the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16725,Brazen Serpent; hee did not make it to himselfe; it was not therefore
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16726,"against the Commandement. But the making of the Golden Calfe by Aaron,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16727,"and the People, as being done without authority from God, was Idolatry;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16728,"not onely because they held it for God, but also because they made it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16729,"for a Religious use, without warrant either from God their Soveraign, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16730,"from Moses, that was his Lieutenant."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16731,"The Gentiles worshipped for Gods, Jupiter, and others; that living, were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16732,men perhaps that had done great and glorious Acts; and for the Children
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16733,"of God, divers men and women, supposing them gotten between an Immortall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16734,"Deity, and a mortall man. This was Idolatry, because they made them so"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16735,"to themselves, having no authority from God, neither in his eternall Law"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16736,"of Reason, nor in his positive and revealed Will. But though our Saviour"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16737,"was a man, whom wee also beleeve to bee God Immortall, and the Son of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16738,God; yet this is no Idolatry; because wee build not that beleef upon
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16739,"our own fancy, or judgment, but upon the Word of God revealed in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16740,"Scriptures. And for the adoration of the Eucharist, if the words of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16741,"Christ, ""This is my Body,"" signifie, ""that he himselfe, and the seeming"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16742,"bread in his hand; and not onely so, but that all the seeming morsells"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16743,"of bread that have ever since been, and any time hereafter shall bee"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16744,"consecrated by Priests, bee so many Christs bodies, and yet all of them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16745,"but one body,"" then is that no Idolatry, because it is authorized by our"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16746,"Saviour: but if that text doe not signifie that, (for there is no other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16747,"that can be alledged for it,) then, because it is a worship of humane"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16748,"institution, it is Idolatry. For it is not enough to say, God can"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16749,transubstantiate the Bread into Christs Body: For the Gentiles also held
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16750,God to be Omnipotent; and might upon that ground no lesse excuse their
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16751,"Idolatry, by pretending, as well as others, as transubstantiation of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16752,"their Wood, and Stone into God Almighty."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16753,"Whereas there be, that pretend Divine Inspiration, to be a supernaturall"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16755,"grace, by doctrine, and study; I think they are in a very dangerous"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16756,Dilemma. For if they worship not the men whom they beleeve to be so
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16757,"inspired, they fall into Impiety; as not adoring Gods supernaturall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16758,"Presence. And again, if they worship them, they commit Idolatry; for the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16759,Apostles would never permit themselves to be so worshipped. Therefore
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16760,"the safest way is to beleeve, that by the Descending of the Dove upon"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16761,"the Apostles; and by Christs Breathing on them, when hee gave them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16762,"the Holy Ghost; and by the giving of it by Imposition of Hands, are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16763,"understood the signes which God hath been pleased to use, or ordain to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16764,"be used, of his promise to assist those persons in their study to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16765,"Preach his Kingdome, and in their Conversation, that it might not be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16766,"Scandalous, but Edifying to others."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16767,Scandalous Worship Of Images
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16768,"Besides the Idolatrous Worship of Images, there is also a Scandalous"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16769,Worship of them; which is also a sin; but not Idolatry. For Idolatry is
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16770,"to worship by signes of an internall, and reall honour: but Scandalous"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16771,"Worship, is but Seeming Worship; and may sometimes bee joined with"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16772,"an inward, and hearty detestation, both of the Image, and of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16773,"Phantasticall Daemon, or Idol, to which it is dedicated; and proceed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16774,"onely from the fear of death, or other grievous punishment; and is"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16789,"knowledge in Christian Doctrine, doe the same, and another follow him;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16790,this is no Scandall given; for he had no cause to follow such example:
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16791,but is a pretence of Scandall which hee taketh of himselfe for an excuse

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16797,"teach Christs Doctrine to all nations, should doe the same, it were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16798,"not onely a sinfull Scandall, in respect of other Christian mens"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16820,"As for the proofs alledged out of Scripture, namely, those examples"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16821,of Images appointed by God to bee set up; They were not set up for the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16822,"people, or any man to worship; but that they should worship God himselfe"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16823,"before them: as before the Cherubins over the Ark, and the Brazen"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16824,"Serpent. For we read not, that the Priest, or any other did worship the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16825,Cherubins; but contrarily wee read (2 Kings 18.4.) that Hezekiah brake
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16826,"in pieces the Brazen Serpent which Moses had set up, because the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16827,"People burnt incense to it. Besides, those examples are not put for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16828,"our Imitation, that we also should set up Images, under pretence"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16829,of worshipping God before them; because the words of the second
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16830,"Commandement, ""Thou shalt not make to thy selfe any graven Image, &c."""
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16831,"distinguish between the Images that God commanded to be set up, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16832,"those which wee set up to our selves. And therefore from the Cherubins,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16833,"or Brazen Serpent, to the Images of mans devising; and from the Worship"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16834,"commanded by God, to the Will-Worship of men, the argument is not good."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16835,"This also is to bee considered, that as Hezekiah brake in pieces the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16836,"Brazen Serpent, because the Jews did worship it, to the end they should"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16837,doe so no more; so also Christian Soveraigns ought to break down the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16838,Images which their Subjects have been accustomed to worship; that there
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16839,"be no more occasion of such Idolatry. For at this day, the ignorant"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16840,"People, where Images are worshipped, doe really beleeve there is a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16841,"Divine Power in the Images; and are told by their Pastors, that some"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16842,of them have spoken; and have bled; and that miracles have been done by
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16843,"them; which they apprehend as done by the Saint, which they think either"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16844,"is the Image it self, or in it. The Israelites, when they worshipped the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16845,"Calfe, did think they worshipped the God that brought them out of Egypt;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16846,"and yet it was Idolatry, because they thought the Calfe either was"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16847,"that God, or had him in his belly. And though some man may think it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16848,"impossible for people to be so stupid, as to think the Image to be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16849,"God, or a Saint; or to worship it in that notion; yet it is manifest"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16850,"in Scripture to the contrary; where when the Golden Calfe was made, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16851,"people said, (Exod. 32. 2.) ""These are thy Gods O Israel;"" and where the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16852,Images of Laban (Gen. 31.30.) are called his Gods. And wee see daily by
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16853,"experience in all sorts of People, that such men as study nothing but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16854,"their food and ease, are content to beleeve any absurdity, rather than"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16855,to trouble themselves to examine it; holding their faith as it were by

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16857,Painting Of Fancies No Idolatry: Abusing Them To Religious Worship Is
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16858,"But they inferre from some other places, that it is lawfull to paint"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16859,"Angels, and also God himselfe: as from Gods walking in the Garden; from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16860,"Jacobs seeing God at the top of the ladder; and from other Visions, and"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16864,"say not, that to draw a Picture after a fancy, is a Sin; but when it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16865,"is drawn, to hold it for a Representation of God, is against the second"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16866,"Commandement; and can be of no use, but to worship. And the same may be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16867,"said of the Images of Angels, and of men dead; unlesse as Monuments of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16868,"friends, or of men worthy remembrance: For such use of an Image, is not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16869,"Worship of the Image; but a civill honoring of the Person, not that is,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16870,"but that was: But when it is done to the Image which we make of a Saint,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16871,"for no other reason, but that we think he heareth our prayers, and is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16872,"pleased with the honour wee doe him, when dead, and without sense, wee"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16873,attribute to him more than humane power; and therefore it is Idolatry.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16874,"Seeing therefore there is no authority, neither in the Law of Moses,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16875,"nor in the Gospel, for the religious Worship of Images, or other"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16881,"of; It cannot be imagined, that the Religious Worship now in use,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16882,"was brought into the Church, by misunderstanding of the Scripture. It"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16883,"resteth therefore, that it was left in it, by not destroying the Images"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16885,How Idolatry Was Left In The Church
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16886,"The cause whereof, was the immoderate esteem, and prices set upon the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16887,"workmanship of them, which made the owners (though converted, from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16888,worshipping them as they had done Religiously for Daemons) to retain
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16889,"them still in their houses, upon pretence of doing it in the honor of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16890,"Christ, of the Virgin Mary, and of the Apostles, and other the Pastors"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16891,"of the Primitive Church; as being easie, by giving them new names, to"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16893,"which before perhaps was called the Image of Venus, and Cupid; and so of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16894,"a Jupiter to make a Barnabas, and of Mercury a Paul, and the like. And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16895,"as worldly ambition creeping by degrees into the Pastors, drew them to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16896,an endeavour of pleasing the new made Christians; and also to a liking
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16897,"of this kind of honour, which they also might hope for after their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16898,"decease, as well as those that had already gained it: so the worshipping"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16899,"of the Images of Christ and his Apostles, grow more and more Idolatrous;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16900,"save that somewhat after the time of Constantine, divers Emperors, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16901,"Bishops, and generall Councells observed, and opposed the unlawfulnesse"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16902,"thereof; but too late, or too weakly."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16903,Canonizing Of Saints
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16904,"The Canonizing of Saints, is another Relique of Gentilisme: It is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16905,"neither a misunderstanding of Scripture, nor a new invention of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16906,"Roman Church, but a custome as ancient as the Common-wealth of Rome it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16907,"self. The first that ever was canonized at Rome, was Romulus, and that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16908,"upon the narration of Julius Proculus, that swore before the Senate,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16909,"he spake with him after his death, and was assured by him, he dwelt in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16910,"Heaven, and was there called Quirinius, and would be propitious to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16911,the State of their new City: And thereupon the Senate gave Publique
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16912,"Testimony of his Sanctity. Julius Caesar, and other Emperors after him,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16913,"had the like Testimony; that is, were Canonized for Saints; now defined;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16914,and is the same with the Apotheosis of the Heathen.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16915,The Name Of Pontifex
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16916,"It is also from the Roman Heathen, that the Popes have received the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16917,"name, and power of PONTIFEX MAXIMUS. This was the name of him that in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16918,"the ancient Common-wealth of Rome, had the Supreme Authority under"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16919,"the Senate and People, of regulating all Ceremonies, and Doctrines"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16920,concerning their Religion: And when Augustus Caesar changed the State
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16921,"into a Monarchy, he took to himselfe no more but this office, and that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16922,"of Tribune of the People, (than is to say, the Supreme Power both in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16923,"State, and Religion;) and the succeeding Emperors enjoyed the same. But"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16924,"when the Emperour Constantine lived, who was the first that professed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16925,"and authorized Christian Religion, it was consonant to his profession,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16926,to cause Religion to be regulated (under his authority) by the Bishop
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16927,of Rome: Though it doe not appear they had so soon the name of Pontifex;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16928,"but rather, that the succeeding Bishops took it of themselves, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16929,countenance the power they exercised over the Bishops of the Roman
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16930,"Provinces. For it is not any Priviledge of St. Peter, but the Priviledge"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16931,"of the City of Rome, which the Emperors were alwaies willing to uphold;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16932,that gave them such authority over other Bishops; as may be evidently
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16933,"seen by that, that the Bishop of Constantinople, when the Emperour made"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16934,"that City the Seat of the Empire, pretended to bee equall to the Bishop"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16935,"of Rome; though at last, not without contention, the Pope carryed it,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16936,and became the Pontifex Maximus; but in right onely of the Emperour; and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16937,"not without the bounds of the Empire; nor any where, after the Emperour"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16938,had lost his power in Rome; though it were the Pope himself that took
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16939,"his power from him. From whence wee may by the way observe, that there"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16940,"is no place for the superiority of the Pope over other Bishops, except"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16941,in the territories whereof he is himself the Civill Soveraign; and where
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16942,"the Emperour having Soveraign Power Civill, hath expressely chosen the"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16944,Procession Of Images
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16945,"The carrying about of Images in Procession, is another Relique of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16946,"Religion of the Greeks, and Romans: For they also carried their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16947,"Idols from place to place, in a kind of Chariot, which was peculiarly"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16948,"dedicated to that use, which the Latines called Thensa, and Vehiculum"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16949,"Deorum; and the Image was placed in a frame, or Shrine, which they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16950,"called Ferculum: And that which they called Pompa, is the same that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16951,"now is named Procession: According whereunto, amongst the Divine Honors"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16952,"which were given to Julius Caesar by the Senate, this was one, that in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16953,"the Pompe (or Procession) at the Circaean games, he should have Thensam"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16955,carried up and down as a God: Just as at this day the Popes are carried

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16961,"we read of Caligula, that at his reception to the Empire, he was carried"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16962,"from Misenum to Rome, in the midst of a throng of People, the wayes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16963,"beset with Altars, and Beasts for Sacrifice, and burning Torches: And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16964,"of Caracalla that was received into Alexandria with Incense, and with"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16965,"casting of Flowers, and Dadouchiais, that is, with Torches; for Dadochoi"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16966,were they that amongst the Greeks carried Torches lighted in the

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16972,"The Heathens had also their Aqua Lustralis, that is to say, Holy Water."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16973,The Church of Rome imitates them also in their Holy Dayes. They had

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16980,"these are all the Ceremonies that have been left in the Church, from the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,45,16981,first conversion of the Gentiles: but they are all that I can for the

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,16989,What Philosophy Is
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,16990,"By Philosophy is understood ""the Knowledge acquired by Reasoning, from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,16991,"the Manner of the Generation of any thing, to the Properties; or from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,16992,"the Properties, to some possible Way of Generation of the same; to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,16993,"end to bee able to produce, as far as matter, and humane force permit,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,16994,"such Effects, as humane life requireth."" So the Geometrician, from the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,16995,"Construction of Figures, findeth out many Properties thereof; and from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,16996,"the Properties, new Ways of their Construction, by Reasoning; to the end"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,16997,to be able to measure Land and Water; and for infinite other uses. So
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,16998,"the Astronomer, from the Rising, Setting, and Moving of the Sun, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,16999,"Starres, in divers parts of the Heavens, findeth out the Causes of Day,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17000,"and Night, and of the different Seasons of the Year; whereby he keepeth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17001,an account of Time: And the like of other Sciences.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17002,Prudence No Part Of Philosophy
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17003,"By which Definition it is evident, that we are not to account as any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17004,"part thereof, that originall knowledge called Experience, in which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17005,"consisteth Prudence: Because it is not attained by Reasoning, but found"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17006,"as well in Brute Beasts, as in Man; and is but a Memory of successions"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17007,"of events in times past, wherein the omission of every little"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17008,"circumstance altering the effect, frustrateth the expectation of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17009,"most Prudent: whereas nothing is produced by Reasoning aright, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17010,"generall, eternall, and immutable Truth."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17011,No False Doctrine Is Part Of Philosophy
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17012,Nor are we therefore to give that name to any false Conclusions: For he
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17013,"that Reasoneth aright in words he understandeth, can never conclude an"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17014,Error:
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17015,No More Is Revelation Supernaturall
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17016,Nor to that which any man knows by supernaturall Revelation; because it
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17017,is not acquired by Reasoning:
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17018,Nor Learning Taken Upon Credit Of Authors
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17019,Nor that which is gotten by Reasoning from the Authority of Books;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17020,"because it is not by Reasoning from the Cause to the Effect, nor from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17021,"the Effect to the Cause; and is not Knowledge, but Faith."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17022,Of The Beginnings And Progresse Of Philosophy
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17023,"The faculty of Reasoning being consequent to the use of Speech, it was"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17024,"not possible, but that there should have been some generall Truthes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17025,"found out by Reasoning, as ancient almost as Language it selfe. The"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17026,"Savages of America, are not without some good Morall Sentences; also"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17027,"they have a little Arithmetick, to adde, and divide in Numbers not too"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17028,great: but they are not therefore Philosophers. For as there were Plants
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17029,"of Corn and Wine in small quantity dispersed in the Fields and Woods,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17030,"before men knew their vertue, or made use of them for their nourishment,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17031,"or planted them apart in Fields, and Vineyards; in which time they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17032,"fed on Akorns, and drank Water: so also there have been divers true,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17033,"generall, and profitable Speculations from the beginning; as being the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17034,naturall plants of humane Reason: But they were at first but few in
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17035,number; men lived upon grosse Experience; there was no Method; that is
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17036,"to say, no Sowing, nor Planting of Knowledge by it self, apart from the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17037,"Weeds, and common Plants of Errour and Conjecture: And the cause of it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17038,"being the want of leasure from procuring the necessities of life, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17039,"defending themselves against their neighbours, it was impossible, till"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17040,"the erecting of great Common-wealths, it should be otherwise. Leasure"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17041,"is the mother of Philosophy; and Common-wealth, the mother of Peace, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17042,"Leasure: Where first were great and flourishing Cities, there was first"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17043,"the study of Philosophy. The Gymnosophists of India, the Magi of Persia,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17044,"and the Priests of Chaldea and Egypt, are counted the most ancient"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17045,Philosophers; and those Countreys were the most ancient of Kingdomes.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17046,"Philosophy was not risen to the Graecians, and other people of the West,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17047,"whose Common-wealths (no greater perhaps then Lucca, or Geneva) had"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17048,"never Peace, but when their fears of one another were equall; nor the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17049,"Leasure to observe any thing but one another. At length, when Warre had"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17050,"united many of these Graecian lesser Cities, into fewer, and greater;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17051,"then began Seven Men, of severall parts of Greece, to get the reputation"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17052,of being Wise; some of them for Morall and Politique Sentences; and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17053,"others for the learning of the Chaldeans and Egyptians, which was"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17054,"Astronomy, and Geometry. But we hear not yet of any Schools of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17055,Philosophy.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17056,Of The Schools Of Philosophy Amongst The Athenians
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17057,"After the Athenians by the overthrow of the Persian Armies, had gotten"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17058,"the Dominion of the Sea; and thereby, of all the Islands, and Maritime"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17059,"Cities of the Archipelago, as well of Asia as Europe; and were grown"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17060,"wealthy; they that had no employment, neither at home, nor abroad, had"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17061,"little else to employ themselves in, but either (as St. Luke says, Acts"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17062,"17.21.) ""in telling and hearing news,"" or in discoursing of Philosophy"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17063,publiquely to the youth of the City. Every Master took some place for
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17064,"that purpose. Plato in certaine publique Walks called Academia, from one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17065,"Academus: Aristotle in the Walk of the Temple of Pan, called Lycaeum:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17066,"others in the Stoa, or covered Walk, wherein the Merchants Goods were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17067,brought to land: others in other places; where they spent the time of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17068,"their Leasure, in teaching or in disputing of their Opinions: and some"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17069,"in any place, where they could get the youth of the City together to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17070,"hear them talk. And this was it which Carneades also did at Rome, when"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17071,he was Ambassadour: which caused Cato to advise the Senate to dispatch
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17072,"him quickly, for feare of corrupting the manners of the young men that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17073,delighted to hear him speak (as they thought) fine things.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17074,"From this it was, that the place where any of them taught, and disputed,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17075,"was called Schola, which in their Tongue signifieth Leasure; and their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17076,"Disputations, Diatribae, that is to say, Passing of The Time. Also the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17077,"Philosophers themselves had the name of their Sects, some of them from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17078,"these their Schools: For they that followed Plato's Doctrine, were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17079,"called Academiques; The followers of Aristotle, Peripatetiques, from the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17080,"Walk hee taught in; and those that Zeno taught, Stoiques, from the Stoa:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17081,"as if we should denominate men from More-fields, from Pauls-Church, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17082,"from the Exchange, because they meet there often, to prate and loyter."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17083,"Neverthelesse, men were so much taken with this custome, that in time"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17084,"it spread it selfe over all Europe, and the best part of Afrique; so as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17085,"there were Schools publiquely erected, and maintained for Lectures, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17086,"Disputations, almost in every Common-wealth."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17087,Of The Schools Of The Jews
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17088,"There were also Schools, anciently, both before, and after the time of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17089,"our Saviour, amongst the Jews: but they were Schools of their Law. For"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17090,"though they were called Synagogues, that is to say, Congregations of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17091,"People; yet in as much as the Law was every Sabbath day read, expounded,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17092,"and disputed in them, they differed not in nature, but in name onely"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17093,"from Publique Schools; and were not onely in Jerusalem, but in every"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17094,"City of the Gentiles, where the Jews inhabited. There was such a Schoole"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17095,"at Damascus, whereinto Paul entred, to persecute. There were others at"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17096,"Antioch, Iconium and Thessalonica, whereinto he entred, to dispute:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17097,"And such was the Synagogue of the Libertines, Cyrenians, Alexandrians,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17098,"Cilicians, and those of Asia; that is to say, the Schoole of Libertines,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17099,"and of Jewes, that were strangers in Jerusalem: And of this Schoole they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17100,were that disputed with Saint Steven.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17101,The Schoole Of Graecians Unprofitable
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17102,But what has been the Utility of those Schools? what Science is there
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17103,at this day acquired by their Readings and Disputings? That wee have
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17104,"of Geometry, which is the Mother of all Naturall Science, wee are not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17105,indebted for it to the Schools. Plato that was the best Philosopher
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17106,"of the Greeks, forbad entrance into his Schoole, to all that were not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17107,already in some measure Geometricians. There were many that studied that
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17108,Science to the great advantage of mankind: but there is no mention of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17109,their Schools; nor was there any Sect of Geometricians; nor did they
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17110,then passe under the name of Philosophers. The naturall Philosophy
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17111,"of those Schools, was rather a Dream than Science, and set forth in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17112,senselesse and insignificant Language; which cannot be avoided by
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17113,"those that will teach Philosophy, without having first attained great"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17114,"knowledge in Geometry: For Nature worketh by Motion; the Wayes,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17115,"and Degrees whereof cannot be known, without the knowledge of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17116,"Proportions and Properties of Lines, and Figures. Their Morall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17117,Philosophy is but a description of their own Passions. For the rule of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17118,"Manners, without Civill Government, is the Law of Nature; and in it,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17119,"the Law Civill; that determineth what is Honest, and Dishonest; what is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17120,"Just, and Unjust; and generally what is Good, and Evill: whereas they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17121,"make the Rules of Good, and Bad, by their own Liking, and Disliking: By"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17122,"which means, in so great diversity of taste, there is nothing generally"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17123,agreed on; but every one doth (as far as he dares) whatsoever seemeth
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17124,"good in his own eyes, to the subversion of Common-wealth. Their Logique"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17125,"which should bee the Method of Reasoning, is nothing else but Captions"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17126,"of Words, and Inventions how to puzzle such as should goe about to pose"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17127,"them. To conclude there is nothing so absurd, that the old Philosophers"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17128,"(as Cicero saith, who was one of them) have not some of them maintained."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17129,And I beleeve that scarce any thing can be more absurdly said
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17130,"in naturall Philosophy, than that which now is called Aristotles"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17131,"Metaphysiques, nor more repugnant to Government, than much of that hee"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17132,"hath said in his Politiques; nor more ignorantly, than a great part of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17133,his Ethiques.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17134,The Schools Of The Jews Unprofitable
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17135,"The Schoole of the Jews, was originally a Schoole of the Law of Moses;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17136,"who commanded (Deut. 31.10.) that at the end of every seventh year, at"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17137,"the Feast of the Tabernacles, it should be read to all the people, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17138,"they might hear, and learn it: Therefore the reading of the Law (which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17139,"was in use after the Captivity) every Sabbath day, ought to have had"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17140,"no other end, but the acquainting of the people with the Commandements"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17141,"which they were to obey, and to expound unto them the writings of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17142,"Prophets. But it is manifest, by the many reprehensions of them by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17143,"our Saviour, that they corrupted the Text of the Law with their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17144,"false Commentaries, and vain Traditions; and so little understood the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17145,"Prophets, that they did neither acknowledge Christ, nor the works he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17146,did; for which the Prophets prophecyed. So that by their Lectures and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17147,"Disputations in their Synagogues, they turned the Doctrine of their Law"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17148,"into a Phantasticall kind of Philosophy, concerning the incomprehensible"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17149,"nature of God, and of Spirits; which they compounded of the Vain"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17150,"Philosophy and Theology of the Graecians, mingled with their own"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17160,"it hath no otherwise place, then as a handmaid to the Romane Religion:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17161,"And since the Authority of Aristotle is onely current there, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17162,"study is not properly Philosophy, (the nature whereof dependeth not on"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17164,had no place at all; as being subservient to nothing but rigide Truth.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17165,"And if any man by the ingenuity of his owne nature, had attained to any"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17171,partly from Blindnesse of understanding; I shall first consider their

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17186,But the Schools take them for Books Of Supernaturall Philosophy: for the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17187,word Metaphysiques will bear both these senses. And indeed that which is
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17188,"there written, is for the most part so far from the possibility of being"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17189,"understood, and so repugnant to naturall Reason, that whosoever"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17190,"thinketh there is any thing to bee understood by it, must needs think it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17191,supernaturall.

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17193,"From these Metaphysiques, which are mingled with the Scripture to make"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17194,"Schoole Divinity, wee are told, there be in the world certaine"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17195,"Essences separated from Bodies, which they call Abstract Essences, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17196,"Substantiall Formes: For the Interpreting of which Jargon, there is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17197,need of somewhat more than ordinary attention in this place. Also I
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17198,"ask pardon of those that are not used to this kind of Discourse, for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17199,"applying my selfe to those that are. The World, (I mean not the Earth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17200,"onely, that denominates the Lovers of it Worldly Men, but the Universe,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17201,"that is, the whole masse of all things that are) is Corporeall, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17202,"is to say, Body; and hath the dimensions of Magnitude, namely, Length,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17203,"Bredth, and Depth: also every part of Body, is likewise Body, and hath"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17204,"the like dimensions; and consequently every part of the Universe,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17205,"is Body, and that which is not Body, is no part of the Universe: And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17206,"because the Universe is all, that which is no part of it, is Nothing;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17207,"and consequently No Where. Nor does it follow from hence, that Spirits"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17208,"are Nothing: for they have dimensions, and are therefore really Bodies;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17209,"though that name in common Speech be given to such Bodies onely, as are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17210,"visible, or palpable; that is, that have some degree of Opacity: But for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17211,"Spirits, they call them Incorporeall; which is a name of more honour,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17212,and may therefore with more piety bee attributed to God himselfe; in
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17213,"whom wee consider not what Attribute expresseth best his Nature, which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17214,is Incomprehensible; but what best expresseth our desire to honour him.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17215,"To know now upon what grounds they say there be Essences Abstract, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17216,"Substantiall Formes, wee are to consider what those words do properly"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17217,"signifie. The use of Words, is to register to our selves, and make"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17218,manifest to others the Thoughts and Conceptions of our Minds. Of which
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17219,"Words, some are the names of the Things conceived; as the names of all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17220,"sorts of Bodies, that work upon the Senses, and leave an Impression in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17221,the Imagination: Others are the names of the Imaginations themselves;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17222,"that is to say, of those Ideas, or mentall Images we have of all things"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17223,"wee see, or remember: And others againe are names of Names; or of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17224,"different sorts of Speech: As Universall, Plurall, Singular, Negation,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17225,"True, False, Syllogisme, Interrogation, Promise, Covenant, are the names"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17226,"of certain Forms of Speech. Others serve to shew the Consequence, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17227,"Repugnance of one name to another; as when one saith, ""A Man is a Body,"""
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17228,hee intendeth that the name of Body is necessarily consequent to the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17229,"name of Man; as being but severall names of the same thing, Man; which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17230,Consequence is signified by coupling them together with the word Is.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17231,"And as wee use the Verbe Is; so the Latines use their Verbe Est, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17232,the Greeks their Esti through all its Declinations. Whether all other
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17233,Nations of the world have in their severall languages a word that
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17234,"answereth to it, or not, I cannot tell; but I am sure they have not need"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17235,of it: For the placing of two names in order may serve to signifie their
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17236,"Consequence, if it were the custome, (for Custome is it, that give words"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17237,"their force,) as well as the words Is, or Bee, or Are, and the like."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17238,"And if it were so, that there were a Language without any Verb"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17239,"answerable to Est, or Is, or Bee; yet the men that used it would bee"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17240,"not a jot the lesse capable of Inferring, Concluding, and of all kind of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17241,"Reasoning, than were the Greeks, and Latines. But what then would become"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17242,"of these Terms, of Entity, Essence, Essentiall, Essentially, that are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17243,"derived from it, and of many more that depend on these, applyed as most"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17244,"commonly they are? They are therefore no Names of Things; but Signes, by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17245,"which wee make known, that wee conceive the Consequence of one name or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17246,"Attribute to another: as when we say, ""a Man, is, a living Body,"" wee"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17247,"mean not that the Man is one thing, the Living Body another, and the Is,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17248,"or Beeing a third: but that the Man, and the Living Body, is the same"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17249,"thing: because the Consequence, ""If hee bee a Man, hee is a living"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17250,"Body,"" is a true Consequence, signified by that word Is. Therefore, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17251,"bee a Body, to Walke, to bee Speaking, to Live, to See, and the like"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17254,elsewhere more amply expressed.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17255,But to what purpose (may some man say) is such subtilty in a work of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17256,"this nature, where I pretend to nothing but what is necessary to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17257,"doctrine of Government and Obedience? It is to this purpose, that men"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17258,"may no longer suffer themselves to be abused, by them, that by this"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17259,"doctrine of Separated Essences, built on the Vain Philosophy of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17260,"Aristotle, would fright them from Obeying the Laws of their Countrey,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17261,with empty names; as men fright Birds from the Corn with an empty
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17262,"doublet, a hat, and a crooked stick. For it is upon this ground, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17263,"when a Man is dead and buried, they say his Soule (that is his Life) can"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17264,"walk separated from his Body, and is seen by night amongst the graves."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17265,"Upon the same ground they say, that the Figure, and Colour, and Tast of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17266,"a peece of Bread, has a being, there, where they say there is no Bread:"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17271,on the Soveraign Power of their Countrey. For who will endeavour to obey
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17272,"the Laws, if he expect Obedience to be Powred or Blown into him? Or who"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17273,"will not obey a Priest, that can make God, rather than his Soveraign;"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17278,which it may be he knew to be false Philosophy; but writ it as a thing

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17291,"nothing else but the Determination, or Defining of its Place; and so"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17292,"both the Terms of the Distinction are the same. And in particular, of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17293,"the Essence of a Man, which (they say) is his Soule, they affirm it,"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17296,than in any one of those Parts. Can any man think that God is served
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17297,"with such absurdities? And yet all this is necessary to beleeve,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17298,"to those that will beleeve the Existence of an Incorporeall Soule,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17299,Separated from the Body.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17300,"And when they come to give account, how an Incorporeall Substance can"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17350,"downwards toward the Earth, and others goe naturally from it; The"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17351,"Schools will tell you out of Aristotle, that the bodies that sink"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17399,"produceth them, nor the Operation by which they are produced."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17400,"If such Metaphysiques, and Physiques as this, be not Vain Philosophy,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17401,there was never any; nor needed St. Paul to give us warning to avoid it.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17402,"One Makes The Things Incongruent, Another The Incongruity"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17403,"And for their Morall, and Civill Philosophy, it hath the same, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17404,"greater absurdities. If a man doe an action of Injustice, that is to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17405,"say, an action contrary to the Law, God they say is the prime cause of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17406,"the Law, and also the prime cause of that, and all other Actions; but no"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17407,cause at all of the Injustice; which is the Inconformity of the Action
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17408,"to the Law. This is Vain Philosophy. A man might as well say, that one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17409,"man maketh both a streight line, and a crooked, and another maketh their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17410,Incongruity. And such is the Philosophy of all men that resolve of their
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17411,"Conclusions, before they know their Premises; pretending to comprehend,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17412,that which is Incomprehensible; and of Attributes of Honour to make
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17413,Attributes of Nature; as this distinction was made to maintain the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17414,"Doctrine of Free-Will, that is, of a Will of man, not subject to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17415,Will of God.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17416,Private Appetite The Rule Of Publique Good:
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17417,"Aristotle, and other Heathen Philosophers define Good, and Evill, by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17418,"Appetite of men; and well enough, as long as we consider them governed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17419,every one by his own Law: For in the condition of men that have no other
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17420,"Law but their own Appetites, there can be no generall Rule of Good, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17421,Evill Actions. But in a Common-wealth this measure is false: Not the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17422,"Appetite of Private men, but the Law, which is the Will and Appetite of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17423,the State is the measure. And yet is this Doctrine still practised; and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17424,"men judge the Goodnesse, or Wickednesse of their own, and of other mens"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17425,"actions, and of the actions of the Common-wealth it selfe, by their own"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17426,"Passions; and no man calleth Good or Evill, but that which is so in his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17427,"own eyes, without any regard at all to the Publique Laws; except onely"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17428,"Monks, and Friers, that are bound by Vow to that simple obedience to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17429,"their Superiour, to which every Subject ought to think himself bound by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17430,the Law of Nature to the Civill Soveraign. And this private measure of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17431,"Good, is a Doctrine, not onely Vain, but also Pernicious to the Publique"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17432,State.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17433,And That Lawfull Marriage Is Unchastity
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17434,"It is also Vain and false Philosophy, to say the work of Marriage is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17435,"repugnant to Chastity, or Continence, and by consequence to make them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17436,"Morall Vices; as they doe, that pretend Chastity, and Continence, for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17437,the ground of denying Marriage to the Clergy. For they confesse it is
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17438,"no more, but a Constitution of the Church, that requireth in those holy"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17439,"Orders that continually attend the Altar, and administration of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17440,"Eucharist, a continuall Abstinence from women, under the name of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17441,"continuall Chastity, Continence, and Purity. Therefore they call the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17442,"lawfull use of Wives, want of Chastity, and Continence; and so make"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17443,"Marriage a Sin, or at least a thing so impure, and unclean, as to render"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17444,a man unfit for the Altar. If the Law were made because the use of Wives
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17445,"is Incontinence, and contrary to Chastity, then all marriage is vice; If"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17446,"because it is a thing too impure, and unclean for a man consecrated to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17447,"God; much more should other naturall, necessary, and daily works which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17448,"all men doe, render men unworthy to bee Priests, because they are more"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17449,unclean.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17450,"But the secret foundation of this prohibition of Marriage of Priests, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17451,"not likely to have been laid so slightly, as upon such errours in Morall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17452,"Philosophy; nor yet upon the preference of single life, to the estate of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17453,"Matrimony; which proceeded from the wisdome of St. Paul, who perceived"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17454,"how inconvenient a thing it was, for those that in those times of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17455,"persecution were Preachers of the Gospel, and forced to fly from one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17456,"countrey to another, to be clogged with the care of wife and children;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17457,"but upon the design of the Popes, and Priests of after times, to make"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17458,"themselves the Clergy, that is to say, sole Heirs of the Kingdome of God"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17459,in this world; to which it was necessary to take from them the use of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17460,"Marriage, because our Saviour saith, that at the coming of his Kingdome"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17461,"the Children of God shall ""neither Marry, nor bee given in Marriage, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17462,"shall bee as the Angels in heaven;"" that is to say, Spirituall. Seeing"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17463,"then they had taken on them the name of Spirituall, to have allowed"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17465,Incongruity.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17466,"And That All Government But Popular, Is Tyranny"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17467,"From Aristotles Civill Philosophy, they have learned, to call all manner"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17468,"of Common-wealths but the Popular, (such as was at that time the state"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17469,"of Athens,) Tyranny. All Kings they called Tyrants; and the Aristocracy"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17470,of the thirty Governours set up there by the Lacedemonians that subdued
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17471,"them, the thirty Tyrants: As also to call the condition of the people"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17472,"under the Democracy, Liberty. A Tyrant originally signified no more"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17473,"simply, but a Monarch: But when afterwards in most parts of Greece that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17474,"kind of government was abolished, the name began to signifie, not onely"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17475,"the thing it did before, but with it, the hatred which the Popular"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17476,States bare towards it: As also the name of King became odious after the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17477,"deposing of the Kings in Rome, as being a thing naturall to all men,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17478,"to conceive some great Fault to be signified in any Attribute, that is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17479,"given in despight, and to a great Enemy. And when the same men shall be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17480,"displeased with those that have the administration of the Democracy,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17481,"or Aristocracy, they are not to seek for disgraceful names to expresse"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17482,"their anger in; but call readily the one Anarchy, and the other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17483,"Oligarchy, or the Tyranny Of A Few. And that which offendeth the People,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17484,"is no other thing, but that they are governed, not as every one of them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17485,"would himselfe, but as the Publique Representant, be it one Man, or an"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17486,"Assembly of men thinks fit; that is, by an Arbitrary government: for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17487,which they give evill names to their Superiors; never knowing (till
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17488,perhaps a little after a Civill warre) that without such Arbitrary
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17489,"government, such Warre must be perpetuall; and that it is Men, and Arms,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17490,"not Words, and Promises, that make the Force and Power of the Laws."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17491,"That Not Men, But Law Governs"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17492,"And therefore this is another Errour of Aristotles Politiques, that in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17493,"a wel ordered Common-wealth, not Men should govern, but the Laws. What"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17494,"man, that has his naturall Senses, though he can neither write nor read,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17495,"does not find himself governed by them he fears, and beleeves can kill"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17496,or hurt him when he obeyeth not? or that beleeves the Law can hurt him;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17497,"that is, Words, and Paper, without the Hands, and Swords of men? And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17498,"this is of the number of pernicious Errors: for they induce men, as oft"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17499,"as they like not their Governours, to adhaere to those that call them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17500,"Tyrants, and to think it lawfull to raise warre against them: And yet"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17501,"they are many times cherished from the Pulpit, by the Clergy."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17502,Laws Over The Conscience
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17503,There is another Errour in their Civill Philosophy (which they never
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17504,"learned of Aristotle, nor Cicero, nor any other of the Heathen,) to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17505,"extend the power of the Law, which is the Rule of Actions onely, to the"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17507,"of what they Hold, notwithstanding the Conformity of their Speech and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17508,"Actions: By which, men are either punished for answering the truth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17509,"of their thoughts, or constrained to answer an untruth for fear of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17510,"punishment. It is true, that the Civill Magistrate, intending to employ"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17511,"a Minister in the charge of Teaching, may enquire of him, if hee bee"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17512,"content to Preach such, and such Doctrines; and in case of refusall,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17513,may deny him the employment: But to force him to accuse himselfe of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17514,"Opinions, when his Actions are not by Law forbidden, is against the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17515,"Law of Nature; and especially in them, who teach, that a man shall bee"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17520,rather than that of any other man that is unconcerned in his damnation?
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17521,Private Interpretation Of Law
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17522,"For a Private man, without the Authority of the Common-wealth, that is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17523,"to say, without permission from the Representant thereof, to Interpret"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17524,"the Law by his own Spirit, is another Error in the Politiques; but not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17525,"drawn from Aristotle, nor from any other of the Heathen Philosophers."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17526,"For none of them deny, but that in the Power of making Laws, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17527,comprehended also the Power of Explaining them when there is need. And
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17528,"are not the Scriptures, in all places where they are Law, made Law by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17529,"the Authority of the Common-wealth, and consequently, a part of the"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17549,"More examples of Vain Philosophy, brought into Religion by the Doctors"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,46,17550,"of Schoole-Divinity, might be produced; but other men may if they please"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17613,"Cicero maketh honorable mention of one of the Cassii, a severe Judge"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17614,"amongst the Romans, for a custome he had, in Criminal causes, (when the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17615,"testimony of the witnesses was not sufficient,) to ask the Accusers,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17616,"Cui Bono; that is to say, what Profit, Honor, or other Contentment, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17617,"accused obtained, or expected by the Fact. For amongst Praesumptions,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17618,"there is none that so evidently declareth the Author, as doth the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17619,BENEFIT of the Action. By the same rule I intend in this place to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17620,"examine, who they may be, that have possessed the People so long in this"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17621,"part of Christendome, with these Doctrines, contrary to the Peaceable"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17622,Societies of Mankind.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17623,"That The Church Militant Is The Kingdome Of God, Was First Taught By"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17624,The Church Of Rome
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17625,"And first, to this Error, That The Present Church Now Militant On Earth,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17626,"Is The Kingdome Of God, (that is, the Kingdome of Glory, or the Land of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17627,"Promise; not the Kingdome of Grace, which is but a Promise of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17628,"Land,) are annexed these worldly Benefits, First, that the Pastors,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17629,"and Teachers of the Church, are entitled thereby, as Gods Publique"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17630,"Ministers, to a Right of Governing the Church; and consequently (because"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17631,"the Church, and Common-wealth are the same Persons) to be Rectors, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17632,"Governours of the Common-wealth. By this title it is, that the Pope"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17633,"prevailed with the subjects of all Christian Princes, to beleeve, that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17634,"to disobey him, was to disobey Christ himselfe; and in all differences"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17635,"between him and other Princes, (charmed with the word Power Spirituall,)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17636,to abandon their lawfull Soveraigns; which is in effect an universall
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17637,Monarchy over all Christendome. For though they were first invested in
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17638,"the right of being Supreme Teachers of Christian Doctrine, by, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17639,"under Christian Emperors, within the limits of the Romane Empire (as is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17640,"acknowledged by themselves) by the title of Pontifex Maximus, who was an"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17641,"Officer subject to the Civill State; yet after the Empire was divided,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17642,"and dissolved, it was not hard to obtrude upon the people already"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17643,"subject to them, another Title, namely, the Right of St. Peter; not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17644,onely to save entire their pretended Power; but also to extend the same
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17645,"over the same Christian Provinces, though no more united in the Empire"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17646,"of Rome. This Benefit of an Universall Monarchy, (considering the desire"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17647,"of men to bear Rule) is a sufficient Presumption, that the popes that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17648,"pretended to it, and for a long time enjoyed it, were the Authors of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17649,"the Doctrine, by which it was obtained; namely, that the Church now"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17650,"on Earth, is the Kingdome of Christ. For that granted, it must be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17651,"understood, that Christ hath some Lieutenant amongst us, by whom we are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17652,to be told what are his Commandements.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17653,After that certain Churches had renounced this universall Power of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17654,"Pope, one would expect in reason, that the Civill Soveraigns in all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17655,"those Churches, should have recovered so much of it, as (before they had"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17656,"unadvisedly let it goe) was their own Right, and in their own hands."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17657,"And in England it was so in effect; saving that they, by whom the Kings"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17658,"administred the Government of Religion, by maintaining their imployment"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17659,"to be in Gods Right, seemed to usurp, if not a Supremacy, yet an"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17660,"Independency on the Civill Power: and they but seemed to usurp it, in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17661,"as much as they acknowledged a Right in the King, to deprive them of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17662,Exercise of their Functions at his pleasure.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17663,And Maintained Also By The Presbytery
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17664,"But in those places where the Presbytery took that Office, though many"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17665,other Doctrines of the Church of Rome were forbidden to be taught; yet
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17666,"this Doctrine, that the Kingdome of Christ is already come, and that it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17667,"began at the Resurrection of our Saviour, was still retained. But Cui"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17668,Bono? What Profit did they expect from it? The same which the Popes
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17669,expected: to have a Soveraign Power over the People. For what is it for
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17670,"men to excommunicate their lawful King, but to keep him from all places"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17671,of Gods publique Service in his own Kingdom? and with force to resist
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17672,"him, when he with force endeavoureth to correct them? Or what is it,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17673,"without Authority from the Civill Soveraign, to excommunicate any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17674,"person, but to take from him his Lawfull Liberty, that is, to usurpe"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17675,an unlawfull Power over their Brethren? The Authors therefore of this
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17676,"Darknesse in Religion, are the Romane, and the Presbyterian Clergy."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17677,Infallibility
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17678,"To this head, I referre also all those Doctrines, that serve them to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17679,keep the possession of this spirituall Soveraignty after it is gotten.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17680,"As first, that the Pope In His Publique Capacity Cannot Erre. For who"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17681,"is there, that beleeving this to be true, will not readily obey him in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17682,whatsoever he commands?
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17683,Subjection Of Bishops
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17684,"Secondly, that all other Bishops, in what Common-wealth soever, have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17685,"not their Right, neither immediately from God, nor mediately from their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17686,"Civill Soveraigns, but from the Pope, is a Doctrine, by which there"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17687,"comes to be in every Christian Common-wealth many potent men, (for so"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17688,"are Bishops,) that have their dependance on the Pope, and owe obedience"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17689,"to him, though he be a forraign Prince; by which means he is able, (as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17690,he hath done many times) to raise a Civill War against the State
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17691,that submits not it self to be governed according to his pleasure and

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17694,"Thirdly, the exemption of these, and of all other Priests, and of all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17695,"Monkes, and Fryers, from the Power of the Civill Laws. For by this"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17697,"benefit of the Laws, and are protected by the Power of the Civill State,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17698,which neverthelesse pay no part of the Publique expence; nor are
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17699,"lyable to the penalties, as other Subjects, due to their crimes; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17700,"consequently, stand not in fear of any man, but the Pope; and adhere to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17701,"him onely, to uphold his universall Monarchy."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17702,"The Names Of Sacerdotes, And Sacrifices"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17707,"the making the Lords Supper a Sacrifice, serveth to make the People"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17711,The Sacramentation Of Marriage

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17716,The Single Life Of Priests
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17717,"Sixtly, the Deniall of Marriage to Priests, serveth to assure this Power"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17718,"of the pope over Kings. For if a King be a Priest, he cannot Marry, and"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17757,"the aforesaid rule, of Cui Bono, we may justly pronounce for the Authors"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17758,"of all this Spirituall Darknesse, the Pope, and Roman Clergy, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17759,all those besides that endeavour to settle in the mindes of men this

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17766,"suffered the same for want of foresight of the Sequel, and of insight"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17767,"into the designs of their Teachers, may neverthelesse bee esteemed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17768,"accessories to their own, and the Publique dammage; For without"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17769,their Authority there could at first no seditious Doctrine have been
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17770,publiquely preached. I say they might have hindred the same in the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17771,beginning: But when the people were once possessed by those spirituall
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17772,"men, there was no humane remedy to be applyed, that any man could"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17773,"invent: And for the remedies that God should provide, who never faileth"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17779,"by too much grasping let goe all, as Peters net was broken, by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17780,struggling of too great a multitude of Fishes; whereas the Impatience
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17781,"of those, that strive to resist such encroachment, before their Subjects"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17782,"eyes were opened, did but encrease the power they resisted. I doe not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17783,therefore blame the Emperour Frederick for holding the stirrop to our
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17784,countryman Pope Adrian; for such was the disposition of his subjects
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17785,"then, as if hee had not doe it, hee was not likely to have succeeded in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17786,"the Empire: But I blame those, that in the beginning, when their power"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17787,"was entire, by suffering such Doctrines to be forged in the Universities"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17788,"of their own Dominions, have holden the Stirrop to all the succeeding"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17790,"Soveraigns, to ride, and tire, both them, and their people, at their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17791,pleasure.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17792,"But as the Inventions of men are woven, so also are they ravelled out;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17793,"the way is the same, but the order is inverted: The web begins at the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17794,"first Elements of Power, which are Wisdom, Humility, Sincerity, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17795,"other vertues of the Apostles, whom the people converted, obeyed, out"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17796,"of Reverence, not by Obligation: Their Consciences were free, and their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17797,Words and Actions subject to none but the Civill Power. Afterwards the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17798,Presbyters (as the Flocks of Christ encreased) assembling to consider
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17799,"what they should teach, and thereby obliging themselves to teach nothing"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17800,"against the Decrees of their Assemblies, made it to be thought the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17801,"people were thereby obliged to follow their Doctrine, and when"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17802,"they refused, refused to keep them company, (that was then called"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17803,"Excommunication,) not as being Infidels, but as being disobedient: And"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17804,this was the first knot upon their Liberty. And the number of Presbyters
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17805,"encreasing, the Presbyters of the chief City or Province, got themselves"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17806,"an authority over the parochiall Presbyters, and appropriated to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17807,themselves the names of Bishops: And this was a second knot on Christian
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17808,"Liberty. Lastly, the Bishop of Rome, in regard of the Imperiall City,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17809,took upon him an Authority (partly by the wills of the Emperours
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17810,"themselves, and by the title of Pontifex Maximus, and at last when the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17811,"Emperours were grown weak, by the priviledges of St. Peter) over all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17812,"other Bishops of the Empire: Which was the third and last knot, and the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17813,whole Synthesis and Construction of the Pontificall Power.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17814,"And therefore the Analysis, or Resolution is by the same way; but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17815,beginning with the knot that was last tyed; as wee may see in the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17816,dissolution of the praeterpoliticall Church Government in England.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17817,"First, the Power of the Popes was dissolved totally by Queen Elizabeth;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17818,"and the Bishops, who before exercised their Functions in Right of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17819,"Pope, did afterwards exercise the same in Right of the Queen and her"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17820,"Successours; though by retaining the phrase of Jure Divino, they were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17821,thought to demand it by immediate Right from God: And so was untyed the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17822,"first knot. After this, the Presbyterians lately in England obtained the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17823,putting down of Episcopacy: And so was the second knot dissolved:
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17824,"And almost at the same time, the Power was taken also from the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17825,Presbyterians: And so we are reduced to the Independency of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17826,"Primitive Christians to follow Paul, or Cephas, or Apollos, every man"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17827,"as he liketh best: Which, if it be without contention, and without"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17828,"measuring the Doctrine of Christ, by our affection to the Person of his"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17933,"A REVIEW, AND CONCLUSION"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17934,"From the contrariety of some of the Naturall Faculties of the Mind, one"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17935,"to another, as also of one Passion to another, and from their reference"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17936,"to Conversation, there has been an argument taken, to inferre an"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17937,impossibility that any one man should be sufficiently disposed to all
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17938,"sorts of Civill duty. The Severity of Judgment, they say, makes men"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17939,"Censorious, and unapt to pardon the Errours and Infirmities of other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17940,"men: and on the other side, Celerity of Fancy, makes the thoughts lesse"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17941,"steddy than is necessary, to discern exactly between Right and Wrong."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17942,"Again, in all Deliberations, and in all Pleadings, the faculty of solid"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17943,"Reasoning, is necessary: for without it, the Resolutions of men are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17944,"rash, and their Sentences unjust: and yet if there be not powerfull"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17945,"Eloquence, which procureth attention and Consent, the effect of Reason"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17946,will be little. But these are contrary Faculties; the former being
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17947,grounded upon principles of Truth; the other upon Opinions already
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17948,"received, true, or false; and upon the Passions and Interests of men,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17949,"which are different, and mutable."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17950,"And amongst the Passions, Courage, (by which I mean the Contempt of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17951,"Wounds, and violent Death) enclineth men to private Revenges, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17952,sometimes to endeavour the unsetling of the Publique Peace; And
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17953,"Timorousnesse, many times disposeth to the desertion of the Publique"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17954,Defence. Both these they say cannot stand together in the same person.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17955,"And to consider the contrariety of mens Opinions, and Manners in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17956,"generall, It is they say, impossible to entertain a constant Civill"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17957,"Amity with all those, with whom the Businesse of the world constrains"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17958,us to converse: Which Businesse consisteth almost in nothing else but a
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17959,"perpetuall contention for Honor, Riches, and Authority."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17960,"To which I answer, that these are indeed great difficulties, but not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17961,"Impossibilities: For by Education, and Discipline, they may bee, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17962,"are sometimes reconciled. Judgment, and Fancy may have place in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17963,same man; but by turnes; as the end which he aimeth at requireth. As the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17964,"Israelites in Egypt, were sometimes fastened to their labour of making"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17965,"Bricks, and other times were ranging abroad to gather Straw: So also may"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17966,"the Judgment sometimes be fixed upon one certain Consideration, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17967,"the Fancy at another time wandring about the world. So also Reason,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17968,"and Eloquence, (though not perhaps in the Naturall Sciences, yet in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17969,Morall) may stand very well together. For wheresoever there is place for
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17970,"adorning and preferring of Errour, there is much more place for adorning"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17971,"and preferring of Truth, if they have it to adorn. Nor is there any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17972,"repugnancy between fearing the Laws, and not fearing a publique Enemy;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17973,"nor between abstaining from Injury, and pardoning it in others. There is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17974,"therefore no such Inconsistence of Humane Nature, with Civill Duties,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17975,"as some think. I have known cleernesse of Judgment, and largenesse of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17976,"Fancy; strength of Reason, and gracefull Elocution; a Courage for the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17977,"Warre, and a Fear for the Laws, and all eminently in one man; and that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17978,was my most noble and honored friend Mr. Sidney Godolphin; who hating no

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17980,"late Civill warre, in the Publique quarrel, by an indiscerned, and an"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17981,undiscerning hand.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17982,"To the Laws of Nature, declared in the 15. Chapter, I would have this"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17983,"added, ""That every man is bound by Nature, as much as in him lieth, to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17984,"protect in Warre, the Authority, by which he is himself protected in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17985,"time of Peace."" For he that pretendeth a Right of Nature to preserve"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17986,"his owne body, cannot pretend a Right of Nature to destroy him, by whose"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17987,strength he is preserved: It is a manifest contradiction of himselfe.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17988,"And though this Law may bee drawn by consequence, from some of those"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17989,that are there already mentioned; yet the Times require to have it
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17990,"inculcated, and remembred."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17991,"And because I find by divers English Books lately printed, that the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17992,"Civill warres have not yet sufficiently taught men, in what point of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17993,"time it is, that a Subject becomes obliged to the Conquerour; nor what"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17994,"is Conquest; nor how it comes about, that it obliges men to obey his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17995,"Laws: Therefore for farther satisfaction of men therein, I say, the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17996,"point of time, wherein a man becomes subject of a Conquerour, is that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17997,"point, wherein having liberty to submit to him, he consenteth, either by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17998,"expresse words, or by other sufficient sign, to be his Subject. When it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,17999,"is that a man hath the liberty to submit, I have showed before in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18000,"end of the 21. Chapter; namely, that for him that hath no obligation to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18001,"his former Soveraign but that of an ordinary Subject, it is then, when"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18002,the means of his life is within the Guards and Garrisons of the Enemy;
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18003,"for it is then, that he hath no longer Protection from him, but is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18004,protected by the adverse party for his Contribution. Seeing
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18005,"therefore such contribution is every where, as a thing inevitable,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18006,"(notwithstanding it be an assistance to the Enemy,) esteemed lawfull;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18007,"as totall Submission, which is but an assistance to the Enemy, cannot"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18008,"be esteemed unlawfull. Besides, if a man consider that they who submit,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18009,"assist the Enemy but with part of their estates, whereas they that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18010,"refuse, assist him with the whole, there is no reason to call their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18011,"Submission, or Composition an Assistance; but rather a Detriment to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18012,"Enemy. But if a man, besides the obligation of a Subject, hath taken"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18013,"upon him a new obligation of a Souldier, then he hath not the liberty"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18014,"to submit to a new Power, as long as the old one keeps the field, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18015,"giveth him means of subsistence, either in his Armies, or Garrisons:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18016,"for in this case, he cannot complain of want of Protection, and means to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18017,"live as a Souldier: But when that also failes, a Souldier also may seek"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18018,his Protection wheresoever he has most hope to have it; and may lawfully
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18019,submit himself to his new Master. And so much for the Time when he may
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18020,"do it lawfully, if hee will. If therefore he doe it, he is undoubtedly"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18021,"bound to be a true Subject: For a Contract lawfully made, cannot"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18022,lawfully be broken.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18023,"By this also a man may understand, when it is, that men may be said to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18024,"be Conquered; and in what the nature of Conquest, and the Right of a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18025,Conquerour consisteth: For this Submission is it implyeth them all.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18026,"Conquest, is not the Victory it self; but the Acquisition by Victory,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18027,"of a Right, over the persons of men. He therefore that is slain, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18028,"Overcome, but not Conquered; He that is taken, and put into prison, or"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18029,"chaines, is not Conquered, though Overcome; for he is still an Enemy,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18030,"and may save himself if hee can: But he that upon promise of Obedience,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18031,"hath his Life and Liberty allowed him, is then Conquered, and a Subject;"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18032,"and not before. The Romanes used to say, that their Generall had"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18033,"Pacified such a Province, that is to say, in English, Conquered it; and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18034,"that the Countrey was Pacified by Victory, when the people of it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18035,"had promised Imperata Facere, that is, To Doe What The Romane People"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18036,Commanded Them: this was to be Conquered. But this promise may be either
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18037,"expresse, or tacite: Expresse, by Promise: Tacite, by other signes. As"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18038,"for example, a man that hath not been called to make such an expresse"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18039,"Promise, (because he is one whose power perhaps is not considerable;)"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18040,"yet if he live under their Protection openly, hee is understood to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18041,"submit himselfe to the Government: But if he live there secretly, he is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18042,"lyable to any thing that may bee done to a Spie, and Enemy of the State."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18043,"I say not, hee does any Injustice, (for acts of open Hostility bear not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18044,"that name); but that he may be justly put to death. Likewise, if a man,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18045,"when his Country is conquered, be out of it, he is not Conquered, nor"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18046,"Subject: but if at his return, he submit to the Government, he is bound"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18047,to obey it. So that Conquest (to define it) is the Acquiring of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18048,"Right of Soveraignty by Victory. Which Right, is acquired, in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18049,"peoples Submission, by which they contract with the Victor, promising"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18050,"Obedience, for Life and Liberty."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18051,In the 29th Chapter I have set down for one of the causes of the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18052,"Dissolutions of Common-wealths, their Imperfect Generation, consisting"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18053,in the want of an Absolute and Arbitrary Legislative Power; for want
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18054,"whereof, the Civill Soveraign is fain to handle the Sword of Justice"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18055,"unconstantly, and as if it were too hot for him to hold: One reason"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18056,"whereof (which I have not there mentioned) is this, That they will all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18057,"of them justifie the War, by which their Power was at first gotten,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18058,"and whereon (as they think) their Right dependeth, and not on the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18059,"Possession. As if, for example, the Right of the Kings of England did"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18060,"depend on the goodnesse of the cause of William the Conquerour, and upon"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18061,"their lineall, and directest Descent from him; by which means, there"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18062,would perhaps be no tie of the Subjects obedience to their Soveraign
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18063,at this day in all the world: wherein whilest they needlessely think to
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18064,"justifie themselves, they justifie all the successefull Rebellions that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18065,"Ambition shall at any time raise against them, and their Successors."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18066,Therefore I put down for one of the most effectuall seeds of the Death
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18067,"of any State, that the Conquerours require not onely a Submission of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18068,"mens actions to them for the future, but also an Approbation of all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18069,"their actions past; when there is scarce a Common-wealth in the world,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18070,whose beginnings can in conscience be justified.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18071,"And because the name of Tyranny, signifieth nothing more, nor lesse,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18072,"than the name of Soveraignty, be it in one, or many men, saving that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18073,"they that use the former word, are understood to bee angry with them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18074,they call Tyrants; I think the toleration of a professed hatred of
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18075,"Tyranny, is a Toleration of hatred to Common-wealth in general, and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18076,"another evill seed, not differing much from the former. For to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18077,"Justification of the Cause of a Conqueror, the Reproach of the Cause"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18078,"of the Conquered, is for the most part necessary: but neither of them"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18079,necessary for the Obligation of the Conquered. And thus much I have
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18080,thought fit to say upon the Review of the first and second part of this
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18081,Discourse.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18082,"In the 35th Chapter, I have sufficiently declared out of the Scripture,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18083,"that in the Common-wealth of the Jewes, God himselfe was made the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18084,"Soveraign, by Pact with the People; who were therefore called his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18085,"Peculiar People, to distinguish them from the rest of the world, over"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18086,"whom God reigned not by their Consent, but by his own Power: And that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18087,in this Kingdome Moses was Gods Lieutenant on Earth; and that it was he
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18088,that told them what Laws God appointed to doe Execution; especially
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18089,in Capitall Punishments; not then thinking it a matter of so necessary
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18090,"consideration, as I find it since. Wee know that generally in all"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18091,"Common-wealths, the Execution of Corporeall Punishments, was either put"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18092,"upon the Guards, or other Souldiers of the Soveraign Power; or given"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18093,"to those, in whom want of means, contempt of honour, and hardnesse of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18094,"heart, concurred, to make them sue for such an Office. But amongst the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18095,"Israelites it was a Positive Law of God their Soveraign, that he that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18096,"was convicted of a capitall Crime, should be stoned to death by the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18097,"People; and that the Witnesses should cast the first Stone, and after"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18098,"the Witnesses, then the rest of the People. This was a Law that designed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18099,who were to be the Executioners; but not that any one should throw a
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18100,"Stone at him before Conviction and Sentence, where the Congregation"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18101,was Judge. The Witnesses were neverthelesse to be heard before they
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18102,"proceeded to Execution, unlesse the Fact were committed in the presence"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18103,"of the Congregation it self, or in sight of the lawfull Judges; for"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18104,then there needed no other Witnesses but the Judges themselves.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18105,"Neverthelesse, this manner of proceeding being not throughly understood,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18106,"hath given occasion to a dangerous opinion, that any man may kill"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18107,"another, is some cases, by a Right of Zeal; as if the Executions done"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18108,"upon Offenders in the Kingdome of God in old time, proceeded not from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18109,"the Soveraign Command, but from the Authority of Private Zeal: which, if"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18110,"we consider the texts that seem to favour it, is quite contrary."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18111,"First, where the Levites fell upon the People, that had made and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18112,"worshipped the Golden Calfe, and slew three thousand of them; it was by"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18113,"the Commandement of Moses, from the mouth of God; as is manifest, Exod."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18114,"32.27. And when the Son of a woman of Israel had blasphemed God, they"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18115,"that heard it, did not kill him, but brought him before Moses, who"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18116,"put him under custody, till God should give Sentence against him; as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18117,"appears, Levit. 25.11, 12. Again, (Numbers 25.6, 7.) when Phinehas"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18118,"killed Zimri and Cosbi, it was not by right of Private Zeale: Their"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18119,Crime was committed in the sight of the Assembly; there needed
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18120,"no Witnesse; the Law was known, and he the heir apparent to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18121,"Soveraignty; and which is the principall point, the Lawfulnesse of his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18122,"Act depended wholly upon a subsequent Ratification by Moses, whereof he"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18123,"had no cause to doubt. And this Presumption of a future Ratification, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18124,sometimes necessary to the safety [of] a Common-wealth; as in a sudden
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18125,"Rebellion, any man that can suppresse it by his own Power in the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18126,"Countrey where it begins, may lawfully doe it, and provide to have it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18127,"Ratified, or Pardoned, whilest it is in doing, or after it is done. Also"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18128,"Numb. 35.30. it is expressely said, ""Whosoever shall kill the Murtherer,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18129,"shall kill him upon the word of Witnesses:"" but Witnesses suppose"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18130,"a formall Judicature, and consequently condemn that pretence of Jus"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18131,"Zelotarum. The Law of Moses concerning him that enticeth to Idolatry,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18132,"(that is to say, in the Kingdome of God to a renouncing of his"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18133,"Allegiance) (Deut. 13.8.) forbids to conceal him, and commands the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18134,"Accuser to cause him to be put to death, and to cast the first stone at"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18135,"him; but not to kill him before he be Condemned. And (Deut. 17. ver.4,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18136,"5, 6.) the Processe against Idolatry is exactly set down: For God there"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18137,"speaketh to the People, as Judge, and commandeth them, when a man is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18138,"Accused of Idolatry, to Enquire diligently of the Fact, and finding it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18139,"true, then to Stone him; but still the hand of the Witnesse throweth"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18140,"the first stone. This is not Private Zeal, but Publique Condemnation. In"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18141,"like manner when a Father hath a rebellious Son, the Law is (Deut. 21."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18142,"18.) that he shall bring him before the Judges of the Town, and all the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18143,"people of the Town shall Stone him. Lastly, by pretence of these Laws"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18144,"it was, that St. Steven was Stoned, and not by pretence of Private Zeal:"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18145,"for before hee was carried away to Execution, he had Pleaded his Cause"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18146,"before the High Priest. There is nothing in all this, nor in any other"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18147,"part of the Bible, to countenance Executions by Private Zeal; which"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18148,"being oftentimes but a conjunction of Ignorance and Passion, is against"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18149,both the Justice and Peace of a Common-wealth.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18150,"In the 36th Chapter I have said, that it is not declared in what"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18151,manner God spake supernaturally to Moses: Not that he spake not to him
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18152,"sometimes by Dreams and Visions, and by a supernaturall Voice, as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18153,to other Prophets: For the manner how he spake unto him from the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18154,"Mercy-seat, is expressely set down (Numbers 7.89.) in these words,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18155,"""From that time forward, when Moses entred into the Tabernacle of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18156,"Congregation to speak with God, he heard a Voice which spake unto him"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18157,"from over the Mercy-Seate, which is over the Arke of the Testimony, from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18158,"between the Cherubins he spake unto him."" But it is not declared in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18159,"what consisted the praeeminence of the manner of Gods speaking to Moses,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18160,"above that of his speaking to other Prophets, as to Samuel, and to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18161,"Abraham, to whom he also spake by a Voice, (that is, by Vision) Unlesse"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18162,the difference consist in the cleernesse of the Vision. For Face
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18163,"to Face, and Mouth to Mouth, cannot be literally understood of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18164,"Infinitenesse, and Incomprehensibility of the Divine Nature."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18165,"And as to the whole Doctrine, I see not yet, but the principles of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18166,it are true and proper; and the Ratiocination solid. For I ground the
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18167,"Civill Right of Soveraigns, and both the Duty and Liberty of Subjects,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18168,"upon the known naturall Inclinations of Mankind, and upon the Articles"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18169,"of the Law of Nature; of which no man, that pretends but reason enough"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18170,"to govern his private family, ought to be ignorant. And for the Power"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18171,"Ecclesiasticall of the same Soveraigns, I ground it on such Texts, as"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18172,"are both evident in themselves, and consonant to the Scope of the whole"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18173,"Scripture. And therefore am perswaded, that he that shall read it with"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18174,"a purpose onely to be informed, shall be informed by it. But for those"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18175,"that by Writing, or Publique Discourse, or by their eminent actions,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18176,"have already engaged themselves to the maintaining of contrary opinions,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18177,"they will not bee so easily satisfied. For in such cases, it is naturall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18178,"for men, at one and the same time, both to proceed in reading, and to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18179,"lose their attention, in the search of objections to that they had read"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18180,"before: Of which, in a time wherein the interests of men are changed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18181,"(seeing much of that Doctrine, which serveth to the establishing of a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18182,"new Government, must needs be contrary to that which conduced to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18183,"dissolution of the old,) there cannot choose but be very many."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18184,"In that part which treateth of a Christian Common-wealth, there are"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18185,"some new Doctrines, which, it may be, in a State where the contrary were"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18186,"already fully determined, were a fault for a Subject without leave to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18187,"divulge, as being an usurpation of the place of a Teacher. But in this"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18188,"time, that men call not onely for Peace, but also for Truth, to offer"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18189,"such Doctrines as I think True, and that manifestly tend to Peace and"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18190,"Loyalty, to the consideration of those that are yet in deliberation, is"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18191,"no more, but to offer New Wine, to bee put into New Cask, that bothe may"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18192,"be preserved together. And I suppose, that then, when Novelty can breed"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18193,"no trouble, nor disorder in a State, men are not generally so much"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18194,"inclined to the reverence of Antiquity, as to preferre Ancient Errors,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18195,before New and well proved Truth.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18196,There is nothing I distrust more than my Elocution; which neverthelesse
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18197,I am confident (excepting the Mischances of the Presse) is not obscure.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18198,"That I have neglected the Ornament of quoting ancient Poets, Orators,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18199,"and Philosophers, contrary to the custome of late time, (whether I have"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18200,"done well or ill in it,) proceedeth from my judgment, grounded on many"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18201,"reasons. For first, all Truth of Doctrine dependeth either upon Reason,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18202,"or upon Scripture; both which give credit to many, but never receive it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18203,"from any Writer. Secondly, the matters in question are not of Fact, but"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18204,"of Right, wherein there is no place for Witnesses. There is scarce any"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18205,"of those old Writers, that contradicteth not sometimes both himself,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18206,"and others; which makes their Testimonies insufficient. Fourthly,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18207,"such Opinions as are taken onely upon Credit of Antiquity, are not"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18208,"intrinsically the Judgment of those that cite them, but Words that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18209,"passe (like gaping) from mouth to mouth. Fiftly, it is many times with a"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18210,fraudulent Designe that men stick their corrupt Doctrine with the Cloves
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18211,"of other mens Wit. Sixtly, I find not that the Ancients they cite, took"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18212,"it for an Ornament, to doe the like with those that wrote before them."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18213,"Seventhly, it is an argument of Indigestion, when Greek and Latine"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18214,"Sentences unchewed come up again, as they use to doe, unchanged. Lastly,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18215,"though I reverence those men of Ancient time, that either have written"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18216,"Truth perspicuously, or set us in a better way to find it out our"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18217,selves; yet to the Antiquity it self I think nothing due: For if we will
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18218,"reverence the Age, the Present is the Oldest. If the Antiquity of the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18219,"Writer, I am not sure, that generally they to whom such honor is given,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18220,"were more Ancient when they wrote, than I am that am Writing: But if it"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18221,"bee well considered, the praise of Ancient Authors, proceeds not from"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18222,"the reverence of the Dead, but from the competition, and mutuall envy of"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18223,the Living.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18224,"To conclude, there is nothing in this whole Discourse, nor in that I"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18225,"writ before of the same Subject in Latine, as far as I can perceive,"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18226,"contrary either to the Word of God, or to good Manners; or to the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18227,disturbance of the Publique Tranquillity. Therefore I think it may be
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18228,"profitably printed, and more profitably taught in the Universities, in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18229,"case they also think so, to whom the judgment of the same belongeth."
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18230,"For seeing the Universities are the Fountains of Civill, and Morall"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18231,"Doctrine, from whence the Preachers, and the Gentry, drawing such water"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18232,"as they find, use to sprinkle the same (both from the Pulpit, and in"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18233,"their Conversation) upon the People, there ought certainly to be"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18234,"great care taken, to have it pure, both from the Venime of Heathen"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18235,"Politicians, and from the Incantation of Deceiving Spirits. And by that"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18236,"means the most men, knowing their Duties, will be the less subject to"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18237,"serve the Ambition of a few discontented persons, in their purposes"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18238,against the State; and be the lesse grieved with the Contributions
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18239,"necessary for their Peace, and Defence; and the Governours themselves"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18240,"have the lesse cause, to maintain at the Common charge any greater"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18241,"Army, than is necessary to make good the Publique Liberty, against the"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18242,Invasions and Encroachments of forraign Enemies.
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18243,And thus I have brought to an end my Discourse of Civill and
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18244,"Ecclesiasticall Government, occasioned by the disorders of the present"
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18245,"time, without partiality, without application, and without other"

Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18252,seeing but the backs of them that erect a new;) yet I cannot think
Thomas Hobbes,Leviathan,3207,47,18253,"it will be condemned at this time, either by the Publique Judge of"

John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,20,INTRODUCTION.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,21,I.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,22,"John Stuart Mill was born on 20th May 1806. He was a delicate child, and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,23,the extraordinary education designed by his father was not calculated to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,24,"develop and improve his physical powers. ""I never was a boy,"" he says;"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,25,"""never played cricket."" His exercise was taken in the form of walks with"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,26,"his father, during which the elder Mill lectured his son and examined"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,27,him on his work. It is idle to speculate on the possible results of a
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,28,"different treatment. Mill remained delicate throughout his life, but was"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,29,endowed with that intense mental energy which is so often combined with
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,30,physical weakness. His youth was sacrificed to an idea; he was designed
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,31,by his father to carry on his work; the individuality of the boy was
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,32,"unimportant. A visit to the south of France at the age of fourteen, in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,33,"company with the family of General Sir Samuel Bentham, was not without"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,34,"its influence. It was a glimpse of another atmosphere, though the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,35,"studious habits of his home life were maintained. Moreover, he derived"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,36,"from it his interest in foreign politics, which remained one of his"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,37,characteristics to the end of his life. In 1823 he was appointed junior
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,38,clerk in the Examiners' Office at the India House.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,39,Mill's first essays were written in the _Traveller_ about a year before
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,40,he entered the India House. From that time forward his literary work was
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,41,uninterrupted save by attacks of illness. His industry was stupendous.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,42,"He wrote articles on an infinite variety of subjects, political,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,43,"metaphysical, philosophic, religious, poetical. He discovered Tennyson"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,44,"for his generation, he influenced the writing of Carlyle's _French"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,45,Revolution_ as well as its success. And all the while he was engaged in
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,46,"studying and preparing for his more ambitious works, while he rose step"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,47,by step at the India Office. His _Essays on Unsettled Questions in
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,48,"Political Economy_ were written in 1831, although they did not appear"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,49,"until thirteen years later. His _System of Logic_, the design of which"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,50,"was even then fashioning itself in his brain, took thirteen years to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,51,"complete, and was actually published before the _Political Economy_. In"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,52,"1844 appeared the article on Michelet, which its author anticipated"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,53,"would cause some discussion, but which did not create the sensation he"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,54,"expected. Next year there were the ""Claims of Labour"" and ""Guizot,"" and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,55,in 1847 his articles on Irish affairs in the _Morning Chronicle_. These
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,56,years were very much influenced by his friendship and correspondence
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,57,"with Comte, a curious comradeship between men of such different"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,58,"temperament. In 1848 Mill published his _Political Economy_, to which he"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,59,had given his serious study since the completion of his _Logic_. His
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,60,"articles and reviews, though they involved a good deal of work--as, for"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,61,"instance, the re-perusal of the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_ in the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,62,original before reviewing Grote's _Greece_--were recreation to the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,63,student. The year 1856 saw him head of the Examiners' Office in the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,64,"India House, and another two years brought the end of his official work,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,65,owing to the transfer of India to the Crown. In the same year his wife
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,66,"died. _Liberty_ was published shortly after, as well as the _Thoughts on"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,67,"Parliamentary Reform_, and no year passed without Mill making important"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,68,"contributions on the political, philosophical, and ethical questions of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,69,the day.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,70,"Seven years after the death of his wife, Mill was invited to contest"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,71,Westminster. His feeling on the conduct of elections made him refuse to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,72,"take any personal action in the matter, and he gave the frankest"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,73,"expression to his political views, but nevertheless he was elected by a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,74,large majority. He was not a conventional success in the House; as a
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,75,"speaker he lacked magnetism. But his influence was widely felt. ""For the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,76,"sake of the House of Commons at large,"" said Mr. Gladstone, ""I rejoiced"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,77,"in his advent and deplored his disappearance. He did us all good."" After"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,78,"only three years in Parliament, he was defeated at the next General"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,79,"Election by Mr. W. H. Smith. He retired to Avignon, to the pleasant"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,80,little house where the happiest years of his life had been spent in the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,81,"companionship of his wife, and continued his disinterested labours. He"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,82,"completed his edition of his father's _Analysis of the Mind_, and also"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,83,"produced, in addition to less important work, _The Subjection of Women_,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,84,in which he had the active co-operation of his step-daughter. A book on
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,85,"Socialism was under consideration, but, like an earlier study of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,86,"Sociology, it never was written. He died in 1873, his last years being"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,87,"spent peacefully in the pleasant society of his step-daughter, from"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,88,whose tender care and earnest intellectual sympathy he caught maybe a
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,89,far-off reflection of the light which had irradiated his spiritual life.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,90,II.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,91,The circumstances under which John Stuart Mill wrote his _Liberty_ are
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,92,largely connected with the influence which Mrs. Taylor wielded over his
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,93,career. The dedication is well known. It contains the most extraordinary
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,94,"panegyric on a woman that any philosopher has ever penned. ""Were I but"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,95,capable of interpreting to the world one-half the great thoughts and
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,96,"noble feelings which are buried in her grave, I should be the medium of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,97,a greater benefit to it than is ever likely to arise from anything that
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,98,"I can write, unprompted and unassisted by her all but unrivalled"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,99,"wisdom."" It is easy for the ordinary worldly cynicism to curl a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,100,sceptical lip over sentences like these. There may be exaggeration of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,101,"sentiment, the necessary and inevitable reaction of a man who was"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,102,"trained according to the ""dry light"" of so unimpressionable a man as"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,103,"James Mill, the father; but the passage quoted is not the only one in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,104,which John Stuart Mill proclaims his unhesitating belief in the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,105,intellectual influence of his wife. The treatise on _Liberty_ was
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,106,"written especially under her authority and encouragement, but there are"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,107,many earlier references to the power which she exercised over his mind.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,108,"Mill was introduced to her as early as 1831, at a dinner-party at Mr."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,109,"Taylor's house, where were present, amongst others, Roebuck, W. J. Fox,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,110,and Miss Harriet Martineau. The acquaintance rapidly ripened into
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,111,"intimacy and the intimacy into friendship, and Mill was never weary of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,112,expatiating on all the advantages of so singular a relationship. In some
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,113,"of the presentation copies of his work on _Political Economy_, he wrote"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,114,"the following dedication:--""To Mrs. John Taylor, who, of all persons"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,115,"known to the author, is the most highly qualified either to originate or"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,116,"to appreciate speculation on social advancement, this work is with the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,117,"highest respect and esteem dedicated."" An article on the enfranchisement"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,118,of women was made the occasion for another encomium. We shall hardly be
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,119,"wrong in attributing a much later book, _The Subjection of Women_,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,120,"published in 1869, to the influence wielded by Mrs. Taylor. Finally, the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,121,pages of the _Autobiography_ ring with the dithyrambic praise of his
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,122,"""almost infallible counsellor."""
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,123,The facts of this remarkable intimacy can easily be stated. The
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,124,deductions are more difficult. There is no question that Mill's
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,125,infatuation was the cause of considerable trouble to his acquaintances
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,126,and friends. His father openly taxed him with being in love with another
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,127,"man's wife. Roebuck, Mrs. Grote, Mrs. Austin, Miss Harriet Martineau"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,128,were amongst those who suffered because they made some allusion to a
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,129,forbidden subject. Mrs. Taylor lived with her daughter in a lodging in
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,130,"the country; but in 1851 her husband died, and then Mill made her his"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,131,wife. Opinions were widely divergent as to her merits; but every one
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,132,"agreed that up to the time of her death, in 1858, Mill was wholly lost"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,133,"to his friends. George Mill, one of Mill's younger brothers, gave it as"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,134,"his opinion that she was a clever and remarkable woman, but ""nothing"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,135,"like what John took her to be."" Carlyle, in his reminiscences, described"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,136,"her with ambiguous epithets. She was ""vivid,"" ""iridescent,"" ""pale and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,137,"passionate and sad-looking, a living-romance heroine of the royalist"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,138,"volition and questionable destiny."" It is not possible to make much of a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,139,"judgment like this, but we get on more certain ground when we discover"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,140,"that Mrs. Carlyle said on one occasion that ""she is thought to be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,141,"dangerous,"" and that Carlyle added that she was worse than dangerous,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,142,she was patronising. The occasion when Mill and his wife were brought
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,143,into close contact with the Carlyles is well known. The manuscript of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,144,"the first volume of the _French Revolution_ had been lent to Mill, and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,145,was accidentally burnt by Mrs. Mill's servant. Mill and his wife drove
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,146,"up to Carlyle's door, the wife speechless, the husband so full of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,147,conversation that he detained Carlyle with desperate attempts at
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,148,"loquacity for two hours. But Dr. Garnett tells us, in his _Life of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,149,"Carlyle_, that Mill made a substantial reparation for the calamity for"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,150,which he was responsible by inducing the aggrieved author to accept half
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,151,"of the L200 which he offered. Mrs. Mill, as I have said, died in 1858,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,152,"after seven years of happy companionship with her husband, and was"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,153,buried at Avignon. The inscription which Mill wrote for her grave is too
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,154,"characteristic to be omitted:--""Her great and loving heart, her noble"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,155,"soul, her clear, powerful, original, and comprehensive intellect, made"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,156,"her the guide and support, the instructor in wisdom and the example in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,157,"goodness, as she was the sole earthly delight of those who had the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,158,happiness to belong to her. As earnest for all public good as she was
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,159,"generous and devoted to all who surrounded her, her influence has been"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,160,"felt in many of the greatest improvements of the age, and will be in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,161,those still to come. Were there even a few hearts and intellects like
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,162,"hers, this earth would already become the hoped-for Heaven."" These lines"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,163,"prove the intensity of Mill's feeling, which is not afraid of abundant"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,164,verbiage; but they also prove that he could not imagine what the effect
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,165,"would be on others, and, as Grote said, only Mill's reputation could"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,166,survive these and similar displays.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,167,Every one will judge for himself of this romantic episode in Mill's
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,168,"career, according to such experience as he may possess of the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,169,philosophic mind and of the value of these curious but not infrequent
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,170,"relationships. It may have been a piece of infatuation, or, if we prefer"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,171,"to say so, it may have been the most gracious and the most human page in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,172,Mill's career. Mrs. Mill may have flattered her husband's vanity by
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,173,"echoing his opinions, or she may have indeed been an Egeria, full of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,174,inspiration and intellectual helpfulness. What usually happens in these
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,175,"cases,--although the philosopher himself, through his belief in the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,176,"equality of the sexes, was debarred from thinking so,--is the extremely"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,177,valuable action and reaction of two different classes and orders of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,178,mind. To any one whose thoughts have been occupied with the sphere of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,179,"abstract speculation, the lively and vivid presentment of concrete fact"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,180,comes as a delightful and agreeable shock. The instinct of the woman
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,181,often enables her not only to apprehend but to illustrate a truth for
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,182,which she would be totally unable to give the adequate philosophic
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,183,"reasoning. On the other hand, the man, with the more careful logical"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,184,"methods and the slow processes of formal reasoning, is apt to suppose"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,185,that the happy intuition which leaps to the conclusion is really based
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,186,on the intellectual processes of which he is conscious in his own case.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,187,Thus both parties to the happy contract are equally pleased. The
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,188,abstract truth gets the concrete illustration; the concrete illustration
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,189,finds its proper foundation in a series of abstract inquiries. Perhaps
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,190,"Carlyle's epithets of ""iridescent"" and ""vivid"" refer incidentally to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,191,"Mrs. Mill's quick perceptiveness, and thus throw a useful light on the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,192,mutual advantages of the common work of husband and wife. But it savours
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,193,almost of impertinence even to attempt to lift the veil on a mystery
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,194,"like this. It is enough to say, perhaps, that however much we may"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,195,"deplore the exaggeration of Mill's references to his wife, we recognise"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,196,"that, for whatever reason, the pair lived an ideally happy life."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,197,"It still, however, remains to estimate the extent to which Mrs. Taylor,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,198,"both before and after her marriage with Mill, made actual contributions"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,199,to his thoughts and his public work. Here I may be perhaps permitted to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,200,avail myself of what I have already written in a previous work.[1] Mill
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,201,gives us abundant help in this matter in the _Autobiography_. When first
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,202,"he knew her, his thoughts were turning to the subject of Logic. But his"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,203,"published work on the subject owed nothing to her, he tells us, in its"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,204,doctrines. It was Mill's custom to write the whole of a book so as to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,205,"get his general scheme complete, and then laboriously to re-write it in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,206,order to perfect the phrases and the composition. Doubtless Mrs. Taylor
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,207,was of considerable help to him as a critic of style. But to be a critic
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,208,of doctrine she was hardly qualified. Mill has made some clear
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,209,"admissions on this point. ""The only actual revolution which has ever"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,210,"taken place in my modes of thinking was already complete,""[2] he says,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,211,before her influence became paramount. There is a curiously humble
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,212,"estimate of his own powers (to which Dr. Bain has called attention),"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,213,"which reads at first sight as if it contradicted this. ""During the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,214,greater part of my literary life I have performed the office in relation
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,215,"to her, which, from a rather early period, I had considered as the most"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,216,"useful part that I was qualified to take in the domain of thought, that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,217,"of an interpreter of original thinkers, and mediator between them and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,218,"the public."" So far it would seem that Mill had sat at the feet of his"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,219,oracle; but observe the highly remarkable exception which is made in the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,220,"following sentence:--""For I had always a humble opinion of my own powers"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,221,"as an original thinker, _except in abstract science (logic, metaphysics,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,222,"and the theoretic principles of political economy and politics.)_""[3] If"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,223,"Mill then was an original thinker in logic, metaphysics, and the science"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,224,"of economy and politics, it is clear that he had not learnt these from"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,225,her lips. And to most men logic and metaphysics may be safely taken as
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,226,"forming a domain in which originality of thought, if it can be honestly"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,227,"professed, is a sufficient title of distinction."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,228,Mrs. Taylor's assistance in the _Political Economy_ is confined to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,229,"certain definite points. The purely scientific part was, we are assured,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,230,"not learnt from her. ""But it was chiefly her influence which gave to the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,231,book that general tone by which it is distinguished from all previous
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,232,expositions of political economy that had any pretensions to be
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,233,"scientific, and which has made it so useful in conciliating minds which"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,234,those previous expositions had repelled. This tone consisted chiefly in
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,235,making the proper distinction between the laws of the production of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,236,"wealth, which are real laws of Nature, dependent on the properties of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,237,"objects, and the modes of its distribution, which, subject to certain"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,238,"conditions, depend on human will.... _I had indeed partially learnt this"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,239,view of things from the thoughts awakened in me by the speculations of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,240,"St. Simonians_; but it was made a living principle, pervading and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,241,"animating the book, by my wife's promptings.""[4] The part which is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,242,"italicised is noticeable. Here, as elsewhere, Mill thinks out the matter"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,243,by himself; the concrete form of the thoughts is suggested or prompted
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,244,"by the wife. Apart from this ""general tone,"" Mill tells us that there"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,245,"was a specific contribution. ""The chapter which has had a greater"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,246,"influence on opinion than all the rest, that on the Probable Future of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,247,"the Labouring Classes, is entirely due to her. In the first draft of the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,248,book that chapter did not exist. She pointed out the need of such a
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,249,"chapter, and the extreme imperfection of the book without it; she was"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,250,"the cause of my writing it."" From this it would appear that she gave"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,251,"Mill that tendency to Socialism which, while it lends a progressive"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,252,"spirit to his speculations on politics, at the same time does not"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,253,manifestly accord with his earlier advocacy of peasant proprietorships.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,254,"Nor, again, is it, on the face of it, consistent with those doctrines of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,255,"individual liberty which, aided by the intellectual companionship of his"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,256,"wife, he propounded in a later work. The ideal of individual freedom is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,257,"not the ideal of Socialism, just as that invocation of governmental aid"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,258,to which the Socialist resorts is not consistent with the theory of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,259,_laisser-faire_. Yet _Liberty_ was planned by Mill and his wife in
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,260,concert. Perhaps a slight visionariness of speculation was no less the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,261,attribute of Mrs. Mill than an absence of rigid logical principles. Be
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,262,"this as it may, she undoubtedly checked the half-recognised leanings of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,263,her husband in the direction of Coleridge and Carlyle. Whether this was
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,264,"an instance of her steadying influence,[5] or whether it added one more"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,265,"unassimilated element to Mill's diverse intellectual sustenance, may be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,266,"wisely left an open question. We cannot, however, be wrong in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,267,"attributing to her the parentage of one book of Mill, _The Subjection of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,268,Women_. It is true that Mill had before learnt that men and women ought
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,269,"to be equal in legal, political, social, and domestic relations. This"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,270,was a point on which he had already fallen foul of his father's essay on
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,271,"_Government_. But Mrs. Taylor had actually written on this very point,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,272,and the warmth and fervour of Mill's denunciations of women's servitude
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,273,were unmistakably caught from his wife's view of the practical
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,274,disabilities entailed by the feminine position.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,275,III.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,276,"_Liberty_ was published in 1859, when the nineteenth century was half"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,277,"over, but in its general spirit and in some of its special tendencies"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,278,the little tract belongs rather to the standpoint of the eighteenth
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,279,century than to that which saw its birth. In many of his speculations
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,280,John Stuart Mill forms a sort of connecting link between the doctrines
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,281,of the earlier English empirical school and those which we associate
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,282,"with the name of Mr. Herbert Spencer. In his _Logic_, for instance, he"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,283,"represents an advance on the theories of Hume, and yet does not see how"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,284,profoundly the victories of Science modify the conclusions of the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,285,"earlier thinker. Similarly, in his _Political Economy_, he desires to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,286,"improve and to enlarge upon Ricardo, and yet does not advance so far as"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,287,"the modifications of political economy by Sociology, indicated by some"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,288,later--and especially German--speculations on the subject. In the tract
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,289,"on _Liberty_, Mill is advocating the rights of the individual as against"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,290,Society at the very opening of an era that was rapidly coming to the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,291,conclusion that the individual had no absolute rights against Society.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,292,"The eighteenth century view is that individuals existed first, each with"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,293,their own special claims and responsibilities; that they deliberately
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,294,"formed a Social State, either by a contract or otherwise; and that then"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,295,finally they limited their own action out of regard for the interests of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,296,the social organism thus arbitrarily produced. This is hardly the view
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,297,of the nineteenth century. It is possible that logically the individual
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,298,"is prior to the State; historically and in the order of Nature, the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,299,"State is prior to the individual. In other words, such rights as every"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,300,single personality possesses in a modern world do not belong to him by
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,301,"an original ordinance of Nature, but are slowly acquired in the growth"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,302,and development of the social state. It is not the truth that individual
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,303,liberties were forfeited by some deliberate act when men made themselves
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,304,"into a Commonwealth. It is more true to say, as Aristotle said long ago,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,305,"that man is naturally a political animal, that he lived under strict"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,306,"social laws as a mere item, almost a nonentity, as compared with the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,307,"Order, Society, or Community to which he belonged, and that such"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,308,privileges as he subsequently acquired have been obtained in virtue of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,309,his growing importance as a member of a growing organisation. But if
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,310,"this is even approximately true, it seriously restricts that liberty of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,311,"the individual for which Mill pleads. The individual has no chance,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,312,"because he has no rights, against the social organism. Society can"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,313,punish him for acts or even opinions which are anti-social in character.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,314,His virtue lies in recognising the intimate communion with his fellows.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,315,His sphere of activity is bounded by the common interest. Just as it is
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,316,"an absurd and exploded theory that all men are originally equal, so it"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,317,is an ancient and false doctrine to protest that a man has an individual
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,318,liberty to live and think as he chooses in any spirit of antagonism to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,319,that larger body of which he forms an insignificant part.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,320,"Nowadays this view of Society and of its development, which we largely"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,321,"owe to the _Philosophie Positive_ of M. Auguste Comte, is so familiar"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,322,"and possibly so damaging to the individual initiative, that it becomes"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,323,necessary to advance and proclaim the truth which resides in an opposite
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,324,"theory. All progress, as we are aware, depends on the joint process of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,325,"integration and differentiation; synthesis, analysis, and then a larger"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,326,synthesis seem to form the law of development. If it ever comes to pass
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,327,"that Society is tyrannical in its restrictions of the individual, if, as"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,328,"for instance in some forms of Socialism, based on deceptive analogies of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,329,"Nature's dealings, the type is everything and the individual nothing, it"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,330,must be confidently urged in answer that the fuller life of the future
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,331,"depends on the manifold activities, even though they may be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,332,"antagonistic, of the individual. In England, at all events, we know that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,333,"government in all its different forms, whether as King, or as a caste"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,334,"of nobles, or as an oligarchical plutocracy, or even as trades unions,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,335,"is so dwarfing in its action that, for the sake of the future, the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,336,individual must revolt. Just as our former point of view limited the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,337,"value of Mill's treatise on _Liberty_, so these considerations tend to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,338,show its eternal importance. The omnipotence of Society means a dead
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,339,"level of uniformity. The claim of the individual to be heard, to say"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,340,"what he likes, to do what he likes, to live as he likes, is absolutely"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,341,"necessary, not only for the variety of elements without which life is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,342,"poor, but also for the hope of a future age. So long as individual"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,343,initiative and effort are recognised as a vital element in English
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,344,"history, so long will Mill's _Liberty_, which he confesses was based on"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,345,"a suggestion derived from Von Humboldt, remain as an indispensable"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,346,"contribution to the speculations, and also to the health and sanity, of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,347,the world.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,348,"What his wife really was to Mill, we shall, perhaps, never know. But"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,349,"that she was an actual and vivid force, which roused the latent"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,350,"enthusiasm of his nature, we have abundant evidence. And when she died"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,351,"at Avignon, though his friends may have regained an almost estranged"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,352,"companionship, Mill was, personally, the poorer. Into the sorrow of that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,353,bereavement we cannot enter: we have no right or power to draw the veil.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,354,"It is enough to quote the simple words, so eloquent of an unspoken"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,355,"grief--""I can say nothing which could describe, even in the faintest"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,356,"manner, what that loss was and is. But because I know that she would"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,357,"have wished it, I endeavour to make the best of what life I have left,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,358,and to work for her purposes with such diminished strength as can be
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,0,359,"derived from thoughts of her, and communion with her memory."""

John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,388,CHAPTER I.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,389,INTRODUCTORY.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,390,"The subject of this Essay is not the so-called Liberty of the Will, so"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,391,unfortunately opposed to the misnamed doctrine of Philosophical
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,392,"Necessity; but Civil, or Social Liberty: the nature and limits of the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,393,power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,394,"individual. A question seldom stated, and hardly ever discussed, in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,395,"general terms, but which profoundly influences the practical"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,396,"controversies of the age by its latent presence, and is likely soon to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,397,make itself recognised as the vital question of the future. It is so far
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,398,"from being new, that in a certain sense, it has divided mankind, almost"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,399,from the remotest ages; but in the stage of progress into which the more
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,400,"civilised portions of the species have now entered, it presents itself"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,401,"under new conditions, and requires a different and more fundamental"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,402,treatment.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,403,The struggle between Liberty and Authority is the most conspicuous
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,404,"feature in the portions of history with which we are earliest familiar,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,405,"particularly in that of Greece, Rome, and England. But in old times this"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,406,"contest was between subjects, or some classes of subjects, and the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,407,"government. By liberty, was meant protection against the tyranny of the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,408,political rulers. The rulers were conceived (except in some of the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,409,popular governments of Greece) as in a necessarily antagonistic position
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,410,"to the people whom they ruled. They consisted of a governing One, or a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,411,"governing tribe or caste, who derived their authority from inheritance"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,412,"or conquest, who, at all events, did not hold it at the pleasure of the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,413,"governed, and whose supremacy men did not venture, perhaps did not"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,414,"desire, to contest, whatever precautions might be taken against its"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,415,"oppressive exercise. Their power was regarded as necessary, but also as"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,416,highly dangerous; as a weapon which they would attempt to use against
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,417,"their subjects, no less than against external enemies. To prevent the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,418,weaker members of the community from being preyed upon by innumerable
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,419,"vultures, it was needful that there should be an animal of prey"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,420,"stronger than the rest, commissioned to keep them down. But as the king"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,421,of the vultures would be no less bent upon preying on the flock than any
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,422,"of the minor harpies, it was indispensable to be in a perpetual attitude"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,423,"of defence against his beak and claws. The aim, therefore, of patriots,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,424,was to set limits to the power which the ruler should be suffered to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,425,exercise over the community; and this limitation was what they meant by
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,426,"liberty. It was attempted in two ways. First, by obtaining a recognition"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,427,"of certain immunities, called political liberties or rights, which it"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,428,"was to be regarded as a breach of duty in the ruler to infringe, and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,429,"which if he did infringe, specific resistance, or general rebellion, was"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,430,"held to be justifiable. A second, and generally a later expedient, was"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,431,the establishment of constitutional checks; by which the consent of the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,432,"community, or of a body of some sort, supposed to represent its"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,433,"interests, was made a necessary condition to some of the more important"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,434,"acts of the governing power. To the first of these modes of limitation,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,435,"the ruling power, in most European countries, was compelled, more or"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,436,"less, to submit. It was not so with the second; and to attain this, or"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,437,"when already in some degree possessed, to attain it more completely,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,438,became everywhere the principal object of the lovers of liberty. And so
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,439,"long as mankind were content to combat one enemy by another, and to be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,440,"ruled by a master, on condition of being guaranteed more or less"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,441,"efficaciously against his tyranny, they did not carry their aspirations"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,442,beyond this point.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,443,"A time, however, came, in the progress of human affairs, when men ceased"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,444,to think it a necessity of nature that their governors should be an
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,445,"independent power, opposed in interest to themselves. It appeared to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,446,them much better that the various magistrates of the State should be
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,447,"their tenants or delegates, revocable at their pleasure. In that way"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,448,"alone, it seemed, could they have complete security that the powers of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,449,"government would never be abused to their disadvantage. By degrees, this"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,450,new demand for elective and temporary rulers became the prominent object
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,451,"of the exertions of the popular party, wherever any such party existed;"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,452,"and superseded, to a considerable extent, the previous efforts to limit"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,453,the power of rulers. As the struggle proceeded for making the ruling
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,454,"power emanate from the periodical choice of the ruled, some persons"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,455,began to think that too much importance had been attached to the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,456,limitation of the power itself. _That_ (it might seem) was a resource
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,457,against rulers whose interests were habitually opposed to those of the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,458,"people. What was now wanted was, that the rulers should be identified"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,459,with the people; that their interest and will should be the interest and
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,460,will of the nation. The nation did not need to be protected against its
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,461,own will. There was no fear of its tyrannising over itself. Let the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,462,"rulers be effectually responsible to it, promptly removable by it, and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,463,it could afford to trust them with power of which it could itself
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,464,"dictate the use to be made. Their power was but the nation's own power,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,465,"concentrated, and in a form convenient for exercise. This mode of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,466,"thought, or rather perhaps of feeling, was common among the last"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,467,"generation of European liberalism, in the Continental section of which"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,468,it still apparently predominates. Those who admit any limit to what a
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,469,"government may do, except in the case of such governments as they think"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,470,"ought not to exist, stand out as brilliant exceptions among the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,471,political thinkers of the Continent. A similar tone of sentiment might
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,472,"by this time have been prevalent in our own country, if the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,473,"circumstances which for a time encouraged it, had continued unaltered."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,474,"But, in political and philosophical theories, as well as in persons,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,475,success discloses faults and infirmities which failure might have
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,476,"concealed from observation. The notion, that the people have no need to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,477,"limit their power over themselves, might seem axiomatic, when popular"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,478,"government was a thing only dreamed about, or read of as having existed"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,479,at some distant period of the past. Neither was that notion necessarily
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,480,disturbed by such temporary aberrations as those of the French
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,481,"Revolution, the worst of which were the work of a usurping few, and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,482,"which, in any case, belonged, not to the permanent working of popular"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,483,"institutions, but to a sudden and convulsive outbreak against"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,484,"monarchical and aristocratic despotism. In time, however, a democratic"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,485,"republic came to occupy a large portion of the earth's surface, and made"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,486,itself felt as one of the most powerful members of the community of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,487,nations; and elective and responsible government became subject to the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,488,observations and criticisms which wait upon a great existing fact. It
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,489,"was now perceived that such phrases as ""self-government,"" and ""the power"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,490,"of the people over themselves,"" do not express the true state of the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,491,"case. The ""people"" who exercise the power are not always the same people"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,492,"with those over whom it is exercised; and the ""self-government"" spoken"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,493,"of is not the government of each by himself, but of each by all the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,494,"rest. The will of the people, moreover, practically means, the will of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,495,"the most numerous or the most active _part_ of the people; the majority,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,496,or those who succeed in making themselves accepted as the majority: the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,497,"people, consequently, _may_ desire to oppress a part of their number;"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,498,"and precautions are as much needed against this, as against any other"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,499,"abuse of power. The limitation, therefore, of the power of government"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,500,"over individuals, loses none of its importance when the holders of power"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,501,"are regularly accountable to the community, that is, to the strongest"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,502,"party therein. This view of things, recommending itself equally to the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,503,intelligence of thinkers and to the inclination of those important
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,504,classes in European society to whose real or supposed interests
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,505,"democracy is adverse, has had no difficulty in establishing itself; and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,506,"in political speculations ""the tyranny of the majority"" is now generally"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,507,included among the evils against which society requires to be on its
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,508,guard.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,509,"Like other tyrannies, the tyranny of the majority was at first, and is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,510,"still vulgarly, held in dread, chiefly as operating through the acts of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,511,the public authorities. But reflecting persons perceived that when
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,512,"society is itself the tyrant--society collectively, over the separate"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,513,individuals who compose it--its means of tyrannising are not restricted
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,514,to the acts which it may do by the hands of its political functionaries.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,515,Society can and does execute its own mandates: and if it issues wrong
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,516,"mandates instead of right, or any mandates at all in things with which"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,517,"it ought not to meddle, it practises a social tyranny more formidable"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,518,"than many kinds of political oppression, since, though not usually"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,519,"upheld by such extreme penalties, it leaves fewer means of escape,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,520,"penetrating much more deeply into the details of life, and enslaving the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,521,"soul itself. Protection, therefore, against the tyranny of the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,522,magistrate is not enough: there needs protection also against the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,523,tyranny of the prevailing opinion and feeling; against the tendency of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,524,"society to impose, by other means than civil penalties, its own ideas"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,525,and practices as rules of conduct on those who dissent from them; to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,526,"fetter the development, and, if possible, prevent the formation, of any"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,527,"individuality not in harmony with its ways, and compel all characters to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,528,fashion themselves upon the model of its own. There is a limit to the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,529,legitimate interference of collective opinion with individual
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,530,"independence: and to find that limit, and maintain it against"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,531,"encroachment, is as indispensable to a good condition of human affairs,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,532,as protection against political despotism.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,533,But though this proposition is not likely to be contested in general
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,534,"terms, the practical question, where to place the limit--how to make the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,535,fitting adjustment between individual independence and social
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,536,control--is a subject on which nearly everything remains to be done. All
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,537,"that makes existence valuable to any one, depends on the enforcement of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,538,"restraints upon the actions of other people. Some rules of conduct,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,539,"therefore, must be imposed, by law in the first place, and by opinion on"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,540,many things which are not fit subjects for the operation of law. What
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,541,"these rules should be, is the principal question in human affairs; but"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,542,"if we except a few of the most obvious cases, it is one of those which"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,543,"least progress has been made in resolving. No two ages, and scarcely any"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,544,"two countries, have decided it alike; and the decision of one age or"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,545,country is a wonder to another. Yet the people of any given age and
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,546,"country no more suspect any difficulty in it, than if it were a subject"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,547,on which mankind had always been agreed. The rules which obtain among
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,548,themselves appear to them self-evident and self-justifying. This all but
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,549,universal illusion is one of the examples of the magical influence of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,550,"custom, which is not only, as the proverb says, a second nature, but is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,551,"continually mistaken for the first. The effect of custom, in preventing"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,552,any misgiving respecting the rules of conduct which mankind impose on
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,553,"one another, is all the more complete because the subject is one on"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,554,which it is not generally considered necessary that reasons should be
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,555,"given, either by one person to others, or by each to himself. People are"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,556,"accustomed to believe, and have been encouraged in the belief by some"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,557,"who aspire to the character of philosophers, that their feelings, on"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,558,"subjects of this nature, are better than reasons, and render reasons"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,559,unnecessary. The practical principle which guides them to their opinions
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,560,"on the regulation of human conduct, is the feeling in each person's mind"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,561,"that everybody should be required to act as he, and those with whom he"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,562,"sympathises, would like them to act. No one, indeed, acknowledges to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,563,himself that his standard of judgment is his own liking; but an opinion
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,564,"on a point of conduct, not supported by reasons, can only count as one"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,565,"person's preference; and if the reasons, when given, are a mere appeal"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,566,"to a similar preference felt by other people, it is still only many"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,567,"people's liking instead of one. To an ordinary man, however, his own"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,568,"preference, thus supported, is not only a perfectly satisfactory"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,569,"reason, but the only one he generally has for any of his notions of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,570,"morality, taste, or propriety, which are not expressly written in his"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,571,religious creed; and his chief guide in the interpretation even of that.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,572,"Men's opinions, accordingly, on what is laudable or blamable, are"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,573,affected by all the multifarious causes which influence their wishes in
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,574,"regard to the conduct of others, and which are as numerous as those"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,575,which determine their wishes on any other subject. Sometimes their
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,576,reason--at other times their prejudices or superstitions: often their
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,577,"social affections, not seldom their anti-social ones, their envy or"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,578,"jealousy, their arrogance or contemptuousness: but most commonly, their"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,579,desires or fears for themselves--their legitimate or illegitimate
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,580,"self-interest. Wherever there is an ascendant class, a large portion of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,581,"the morality of the country emanates from its class interests, and its"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,582,"feelings of class superiority. The morality between Spartans and Helots,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,583,"between planters and negroes, between princes and subjects, between"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,584,"nobles and roturiers, between men and women, has been for the most part"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,585,the creation of these class interests and feelings: and the sentiments
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,586,"thus generated, react in turn upon the moral feelings of the members of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,587,"the ascendant class, in their relations among themselves. Where, on the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,588,"other hand, a class, formerly ascendant, has lost its ascendancy, or"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,589,"where its ascendancy is unpopular, the prevailing moral sentiments"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,590,frequently bear the impress of an impatient dislike of superiority.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,591,"Another grand determining principle of the rules of conduct, both in act"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,592,"and forbearance, which have been enforced by law or opinion, has been"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,593,the servility of mankind towards the supposed preferences or aversions
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,594,"of their temporal masters, or of their gods. This servility, though"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,595,"essentially selfish, is not hypocrisy; it gives rise to perfectly"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,596,genuine sentiments of abhorrence; it made men burn magicians and
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,597,"heretics. Among so many baser influences, the general and obvious"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,598,"interests of society have of course had a share, and a large one, in the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,599,"direction of the moral sentiments: less, however, as a matter of reason,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,600,"and on their own account, than as a consequence of the sympathies and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,601,antipathies which grew out of them: and sympathies and antipathies which
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,602,"had little or nothing to do with the interests of society, have made"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,603,themselves felt in the establishment of moralities with quite as great
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,604,force.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,605,"The likings and dislikings of society, or of some powerful portion of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,606,"it, are thus the main thing which has practically determined the rules"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,607,"laid down for general observance, under the penalties of law or"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,608,"opinion. And in general, those who have been in advance of society in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,609,thought and feeling have left this condition of things unassailed in
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,610,"principle, however they may have come into conflict with it in some of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,611,its details. They have occupied themselves rather in inquiring what
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,612,"things society ought to like or dislike, than in questioning whether its"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,613,likings or dislikings should be a law to individuals. They preferred
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,614,endeavouring to alter the feelings of mankind on the particular points
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,615,"on which they were themselves heretical, rather than make common cause"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,616,"in defence of freedom, with heretics generally. The only case in which"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,617,the higher ground has been taken on principle and maintained with
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,618,"consistency, by any but an individual here and there, is that of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,619,"religious belief: a case instructive in many ways, and not least so as"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,620,forming a most striking instance of the fallibility of what is called
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,621,"the moral sense: for the _odium theologicum_, in a sincere bigot, is one"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,622,of the most unequivocal cases of moral feeling. Those who first broke
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,623,"the yoke of what called itself the Universal Church, were in general as"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,624,little willing to permit difference of religious opinion as that church
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,625,"itself. But when the heat of the conflict was over, without giving a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,626,"complete victory to any party, and each church or sect was reduced to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,627,limit its hopes to retaining possession of the ground it already
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,628,"occupied; minorities, seeing that they had no chance of becoming"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,629,"majorities, were under the necessity of pleading to those whom they"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,630,"could not convert, for permission to differ. It is accordingly on this"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,631,"battle-field, almost solely, that the rights of the individual against"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,632,"society have been asserted on broad grounds of principle, and the claim"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,633,"of society to exercise authority over dissentients, openly controverted."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,634,The great writers to whom the world owes what religious liberty it
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,635,"possesses, have mostly asserted freedom of conscience as an indefeasible"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,636,"right, and denied absolutely that a human being is accountable to others"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,637,for his religious belief. Yet so natural to mankind is intolerance in
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,638,"whatever they really care about, that religious freedom has hardly"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,639,"anywhere been practically realised, except where religious indifference,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,640,"which dislikes to have its peace disturbed by theological quarrels, has"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,641,added its weight to the scale. In the minds of almost all religious
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,642,"persons, even in the most tolerant countries, the duty of toleration is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,643,admitted with tacit reserves. One person will bear with dissent in
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,644,"matters of church government, but not of dogma; another can tolerate"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,645,"everybody, short of a Papist or a Unitarian; another, every one who"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,646,believes in revealed religion; a few extend their charity a little
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,647,"further, but stop at the belief in a God and in a future state. Wherever"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,648,"the sentiment of the majority is still genuine and intense, it is found"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,649,to have abated little of its claim to be obeyed.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,650,"In England, from the peculiar circumstances of our political history,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,651,"though the yoke of opinion is perhaps heavier, that of law is lighter,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,652,than in most other countries of Europe; and there is considerable
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,653,"jealousy of direct interference, by the legislative or the executive"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,654,"power, with private conduct; not so much from any just regard for the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,655,"independence of the individual, as from the still subsisting habit of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,656,looking on the government as representing an opposite interest to the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,657,public. The majority have not yet learnt to feel the power of the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,658,"government their power, or its opinions their opinions. When they do so,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,659,individual liberty will probably be as much exposed to invasion from the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,660,"government, as it already is from public opinion. But, as yet, there is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,661,a considerable amount of feeling ready to be called forth against any
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,662,attempt of the law to control individuals in things in which they have
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,663,not hitherto been accustomed to be controlled by it; and this with very
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,664,"little discrimination as to whether the matter is, or is not, within the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,665,"legitimate sphere of legal control; insomuch that the feeling, highly"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,666,"salutary on the whole, is perhaps quite as often misplaced as well"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,667,"grounded in the particular instances of its application. There is, in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,668,"fact, no recognised principle by which the propriety or impropriety of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,669,government interference is customarily tested. People decide according
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,670,"to their personal preferences. Some, whenever they see any good to be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,671,"done, or evil to be remedied, would willingly instigate the government"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,672,to undertake the business; while others prefer to bear almost any amount
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,673,"of social evil, rather than add one to the departments of human"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,674,interests amenable to governmental control. And men range themselves on
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,675,"one or the other side in any particular case, according to this general"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,676,direction of their sentiments; or according to the degree of interest
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,677,which they feel in the particular thing which it is proposed that the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,678,"government should do, or according to the belief they entertain that the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,679,"government would, or would not, do it in the manner they prefer; but"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,680,"very rarely on account of any opinion to which they consistently adhere,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,681,as to what things are fit to be done by a government. And it seems to me
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,682,"that in consequence of this absence of rule or principle, one side is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,683,at present as often wrong as the other; the interference of government
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,684,"is, with about equal frequency, improperly invoked and improperly"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,685,condemned.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,686,"The object of this Essay is to assert one very simple principle, as"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,687,entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,688,"individual in the way of compulsion and control, whether the means used"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,689,"be physical force in the form of legal penalties, or the moral coercion"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,690,"of public opinion. That principle is, that the sole end for which"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,691,"mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,692,"the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,693,the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,694,"member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,695,"others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,696,warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,697,"will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,698,"because, in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise, or even"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,699,"right. These are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoning"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,700,"with him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for compelling"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,701,"him, or visiting him with any evil in case he do otherwise. To justify"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,702,"that, the conduct from which it is desired to deter him must be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,703,calculated to produce evil to some one else. The only part of the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,704,"conduct of any one, for which he is amenable to society, is that which"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,705,"concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,706,"independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,707,"mind, the individual is sovereign."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,708,"It is, perhaps, hardly necessary to say that this doctrine is meant to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,709,apply only to human beings in the maturity of their faculties. We are
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,710,"not speaking of children, or of young persons below the age which the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,711,law may fix as that of manhood or womanhood. Those who are still in a
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,712,"state to require being taken care of by others, must be protected"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,713,against their own actions as well as against external injury. For the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,714,"same reason, we may leave out of consideration those backward states of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,715,society in which the race itself may be considered as in its nonage. The
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,716,"early difficulties in the way of spontaneous progress are so great, that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,717,there is seldom any choice of means for overcoming them; and a ruler
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,718,full of the spirit of improvement is warranted in the use of any
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,719,"expedients that will attain an end, perhaps otherwise unattainable."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,720,Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,721,"barbarians, provided the end be their improvement, and the means"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,722,"justified by actually effecting that end. Liberty, as a principle, has"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,723,no application to any state of things anterior to the time when mankind
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,724,have become capable of being improved by free and equal discussion.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,725,"Until then, there is nothing for them but implicit obedience to an Akbar"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,726,"or a Charlemagne, if they are so fortunate as to find one. But as soon"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,727,as mankind have attained the capacity of being guided to their own
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,728,improvement by conviction or persuasion (a period long since reached in
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,729,"all nations with whom we need here concern ourselves), compulsion,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,730,either in the direct form or in that of pains and penalties for
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,731,"non-compliance, is no longer admissible as a means to their own good,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,732,and justifiable only for the security of others.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,733,It is proper to state that I forego any advantage which could be derived
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,734,"to my argument from the idea of abstract right, as a thing independent"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,735,of utility. I regard utility as the ultimate appeal on all ethical
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,736,"questions; but it must be utility in the largest sense, grounded on the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,737,"permanent interests of man as a progressive being. Those interests, I"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,738,"contend, authorise the subjection of individual spontaneity to external"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,739,"control, only in respect to those actions of each, which concern the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,740,"interest of other people. If any one does an act hurtful to others,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,741,"there is a _prima facie_ case for punishing him, by law, or, where legal"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,742,"penalties are not safely applicable, by general disapprobation. There"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,743,"are also many positive acts for the benefit of others, which he may"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,744,"rightfully be compelled to perform; such as, to give evidence in a court"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,745,"of justice; to bear his fair share in the common defence, or in any"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,746,other joint work necessary to the interest of the society of which he
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,747,enjoys the protection; and to perform certain acts of individual
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,748,"beneficence, such as saving a fellow-creature's life, or interposing to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,749,"protect the defenceless against ill-usage, things which whenever it is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,750,"obviously a man's duty to do, he may rightfully be made responsible to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,751,society for not doing. A person may cause evil to others not only by his
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,752,"actions but by his inaction, and in either case he is justly accountable"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,753,"to them for the injury. The latter case, it is true, requires a much"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,754,more cautious exercise of compulsion than the former. To make any one
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,755,"answerable for doing evil to others, is the rule; to make him answerable"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,756,"for not preventing evil, is, comparatively speaking, the exception. Yet"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,757,there are many cases clear enough and grave enough to justify that
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,758,exception. In all things which regard the external relations of the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,759,"individual, he is _de jure_ amenable to those whose interests are"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,760,"concerned, and if need be, to society as their protector. There are"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,761,often good reasons for not holding him to the responsibility; but these
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,762,reasons must arise from the special expediencies of the case: either
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,763,because it is a kind of case in which he is on the whole likely to act
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,764,"better, when left to his own discretion, than when controlled in any way"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,765,in which society have it in their power to control him; or because the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,766,"attempt to exercise control would produce other evils, greater than"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,767,those which it would prevent. When such reasons as these preclude the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,768,"enforcement of responsibility, the conscience of the agent himself"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,769,"should step into the vacant judgment seat, and protect those interests"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,770,of others which have no external protection; judging himself all the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,771,"more rigidly, because the case does not admit of his being made"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,772,accountable to the judgment of his fellow-creatures.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,773,"But there is a sphere of action in which society, as distinguished from"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,774,"the individual, has, if any, only an indirect interest; comprehending"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,775,all that portion of a person's life and conduct which affects only
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,776,"himself, or if it also affects others, only with their free, voluntary,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,777,"and undeceived consent and participation. When I say only himself, I"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,778,"mean directly, and in the first instance: for whatever affects himself,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,779,may affect others _through_ himself; and the objection which may be
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,780,"grounded on this contingency, will receive consideration in the sequel."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,781,"This, then, is the appropriate region of human liberty. It comprises,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,782,"first, the inward domain of consciousness; demanding liberty of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,783,"conscience, in the most comprehensive sense; liberty of thought and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,784,"feeling; absolute freedom of opinion and sentiment on all subjects,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,785,"practical or speculative, scientific, moral, or theological. The liberty"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,786,of expressing and publishing opinions may seem to fall under a different
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,787,"principle, since it belongs to that part of the conduct of an individual"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,788,"which concerns other people; but, being almost of as much importance as"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,789,"the liberty of thought itself, and resting in great part on the same"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,790,"reasons, is practically inseparable from it. Secondly, the principle"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,791,requires liberty of tastes and pursuits; of framing the plan of our life
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,792,"to suit our own character; of doing as we like, subject to such"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,793,consequences as may follow: without impediment from our
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,794,"fellow-creatures, so long as what we do does not harm them, even though"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,795,"they should think our conduct foolish, perverse, or wrong. Thirdly, from"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,796,"this liberty of each individual, follows the liberty, within the same"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,797,"limits, of combination among individuals; freedom to unite, for any"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,798,purpose not involving harm to others: the persons combining being
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,799,"supposed to be of full age, and not forced or deceived."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,800,"No society in which these liberties are not, on the whole, respected, is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,801,"free, whatever may be its form of government; and none is completely"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,802,free in which they do not exist absolute and unqualified. The only
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,803,"freedom which deserves the name, is that of pursuing our own good in our"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,804,"own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs, or"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,805,impede their efforts to obtain it. Each is the proper guardian of his
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,806,"own health, whether bodily, or mental and spiritual. Mankind are greater"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,807,"gainers by suffering each other to live as seems good to themselves,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,808,than by compelling each to live as seems good to the rest.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,809,"Though this doctrine is anything but new, and, to some persons, may have"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,810,"the air of a truism, there is no doctrine which stands more directly"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,811,opposed to the general tendency of existing opinion and practice.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,812,Society has expended fully as much effort in the attempt (according to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,813,"its lights) to compel people to conform to its notions of personal, as"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,814,of social excellence. The ancient commonwealths thought themselves
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,815,"entitled to practise, and the ancient philosophers countenanced, the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,816,"regulation of every part of private conduct by public authority, on the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,817,ground that the State had a deep interest in the whole bodily and mental
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,818,discipline of every one of its citizens; a mode of thinking which may
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,819,"have been admissible in small republics surrounded by powerful enemies,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,820,in constant peril of being subverted by foreign attack or internal
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,821,"commotion, and to which even a short interval of relaxed energy and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,822,"self-command might so easily be fatal, that they could not afford to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,823,"wait for the salutary permanent effects of freedom. In the modern world,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,824,"the greater size of political communities, and above all, the separation"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,825,between spiritual and temporal authority (which placed the direction of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,826,men's consciences in other hands than those which controlled their
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,827,"worldly affairs), prevented so great an interference by law in the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,828,details of private life; but the engines of moral repression have been
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,829,wielded more strenuously against divergence from the reigning opinion in
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,830,"self-regarding, than even in social matters; religion, the most powerful"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,831,"of the elements which have entered into the formation of moral feeling,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,832,having almost always been governed either by the ambition of a
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,833,"hierarchy, seeking control over every department of human conduct, or by"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,834,the spirit of Puritanism. And some of those modern reformers who have
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,835,"placed themselves in strongest opposition to the religions of the past,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,836,have been noway behind either churches or sects in their assertion of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,837,"the right of spiritual domination: M. Comte, in particular, whose social"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,838,"system, as unfolded in his _Traite de Politique Positive_, aims at"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,839,establishing (though by moral more than by legal appliances) a despotism
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,840,"of society over the individual, surpassing anything contemplated in the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,841,political ideal of the most rigid disciplinarian among the ancient
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,842,philosophers.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,843,"Apart from the peculiar tenets of individual thinkers, there is also in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,844,the world at large an increasing inclination to stretch unduly the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,845,"powers of society over the individual, both by the force of opinion and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,846,even by that of legislation: and as the tendency of all the changes
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,847,"taking place in the world is to strengthen society, and diminish the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,848,"power of the individual, this encroachment is not one of the evils which"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,849,"tend spontaneously to disappear, but, on the contrary, to grow more and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,850,"more formidable. The disposition of mankind, whether as rulers or as"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,851,fellow-citizens to impose their own opinions and inclinations as a rule
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,852,"of conduct on others, is so energetically supported by some of the best"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,853,"and by some of the worst feelings incident to human nature, that it is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,854,hardly ever kept under restraint by anything but want of power; and as
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,855,"the power is not declining, but growing, unless a strong barrier of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,856,"moral conviction can be raised against the mischief, we must expect, in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,857,"the present circumstances of the world, to see it increase."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,858,"It will be convenient for the argument, if, instead of at once entering"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,859,"upon the general thesis, we confine ourselves in the first instance to a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,860,"single branch of it, on which the principle here stated is, if not"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,861,"fully, yet to a certain point, recognised by the current opinions. This"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,862,one branch is the Liberty of Thought: from which it is impossible to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,863,separate the cognate liberty of speaking and of writing. Although these
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,864,"liberties, to some considerable amount, form part of the political"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,865,morality of all countries which profess religious toleration and free
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,866,"institutions, the grounds, both philosophical and practical, on which"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,867,"they rest, are perhaps not so familiar to the general mind, nor so"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,868,"thoroughly appreciated by many even of the leaders of opinion, as might"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,869,"have been expected. Those grounds, when rightly understood, are of much"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,870,"wider application than to only one division of the subject, and a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,871,thorough consideration of this part of the question will be found the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,872,best introduction to the remainder. Those to whom nothing which I am
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,873,"about to say will be new, may therefore, I hope, excuse me, if on a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,874,"subject which for now three centuries has been so often discussed, I"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,1,875,venture on one discussion more.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,876,CHAPTER II.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,877,OF THE LIBERTY OF THOUGHT AND DISCUSSION.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,878,"The time, it is to be hoped, is gone by, when any defence would be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,879,"necessary of the ""liberty of the press"" as one of the securities against"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,880,"corrupt or tyrannical government. No argument, we may suppose, can now"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,881,"be needed, against permitting a legislature or an executive, not"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,882,"identified in interest with the people, to prescribe opinions to them,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,883,and determine what doctrines or what arguments they shall be allowed to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,884,"hear. This aspect of the question, besides, has been so often and so"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,885,"triumphantly enforced by preceding writers, that it need not be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,886,"specially insisted on in this place. Though the law of England, on the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,887,"subject of the press, is as servile to this day as it was in the time of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,888,"the Tudors, there is little danger of its being actually put in force"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,889,"against political discussion, except during some temporary panic, when"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,890,fear of insurrection drives ministers and judges from their
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,891,"propriety;[6] and, speaking generally, it is not, in constitutional"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,892,"countries, to be apprehended that the government, whether completely"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,893,"responsible to the people or not, will often attempt to control the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,894,"expression of opinion, except when in doing so it makes itself the organ"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,895,"of the general intolerance of the public. Let us suppose, therefore,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,896,"that the government is entirely at one with the people, and never thinks"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,897,of exerting any power of coercion unless in agreement with what it
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,898,conceives to be their voice. But I deny the right of the people to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,899,"exercise such coercion, either by themselves or by their government. The"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,900,power itself is illegitimate. The best government has no more title to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,901,"it than the worst. It is as noxious, or more noxious, when exerted in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,902,"accordance with public opinion, than when in or opposition to it. If all"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,903,"mankind minus one, were of one opinion, and only one person were of the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,904,"contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,905,"one person, than he, if he had the power, would be justified in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,906,silencing mankind. Were an opinion a personal possession of no value
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,907,except to the owner; if to be obstructed in the enjoyment of it were
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,908,"simply a private injury, it would make some difference whether the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,909,injury was inflicted only on a few persons or on many. But the peculiar
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,910,"evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is, that it is robbing"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,911,the human race; posterity as well as the existing generation; those who
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,912,"dissent from the opinion, still more than those who hold it. If the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,913,"opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,914,"error for truth: if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,915,"the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,916,collision with error.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,917,"It is necessary to consider separately these two hypotheses, each of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,918,which has a distinct branch of the argument corresponding to it. We can
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,919,never be sure that the opinion we are endeavouring to stifle is a false
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,920,"opinion; and if we were sure, stifling it would be an evil still."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,921,First: the opinion which it is attempted to suppress by authority may
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,922,"possibly be true. Those who desire to suppress it, of course deny its"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,923,truth; but they are not infallible. They have no authority to decide the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,924,"question for all mankind, and exclude every other person from the means"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,925,"of judging. To refuse a hearing to an opinion, because they are sure"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,926,"that it is false, is to assume that _their_ certainty is the same thing"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,927,as _absolute_ certainty. All silencing of discussion is an assumption
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,928,of infallibility. Its condemnation may be allowed to rest on this common
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,929,"argument, not the worse for being common."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,930,"Unfortunately for the good sense of mankind, the fact of their"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,931,"fallibility is far from carrying the weight in their practical judgment,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,932,which is always allowed to it in theory; for while every one well knows
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,933,"himself to be fallible, few think it necessary to take any precautions"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,934,"against their own fallibility, or admit the supposition that any"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,935,"opinion, of which they feel very certain, may be one of the examples of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,936,the error to which they acknowledge themselves to be liable. Absolute
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,937,"princes, or others who are accustomed to unlimited deference, usually"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,938,feel this complete confidence in their own opinions on nearly all
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,939,"subjects. People more happily situated, who sometimes hear their"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,940,"opinions disputed, and are not wholly unused to be set right when they"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,941,"are wrong, place the same unbounded reliance only on such of their"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,942,"opinions as are shared by all who surround them, or to whom they"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,943,habitually defer: for in proportion to a man's want of confidence in his
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,944,"own solitary judgment, does he usually repose, with implicit trust, on"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,945,"the infallibility of ""the world"" in general. And the world, to each"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,946,"individual, means the part of it with which he comes in contact; his"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,947,"party, his sect, his church, his class of society: the man may be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,948,"called, by comparison, almost liberal and large-minded to whom it means"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,949,anything so comprehensive as his own country or his own age. Nor is his
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,950,faith in this collective authority at all shaken by his being aware that
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,951,"other ages, countries, sects, churches, classes, and parties have"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,952,"thought, and even now think, the exact reverse. He devolves upon his own"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,953,world the responsibility of being in the right against the dissentient
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,954,worlds of other people; and it never troubles him that mere accident has
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,955,"decided which of these numerous worlds is the object of his reliance,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,956,"and that the same causes which make him a Churchman in London, would"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,957,have made him a Buddhist or a Confucian in Pekin. Yet it is as evident
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,958,"in itself as any amount of argument can make it, that ages are no more"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,959,infallible than individuals; every age having held many opinions which
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,960,subsequent ages have deemed not only false but absurd; and it is as
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,961,"certain that many opinions, now general, will be rejected by future"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,962,"ages, as it is that many, once general, are rejected by the present."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,963,"The objection likely to be made to this argument, would probably take"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,964,some such form as the following. There is no greater assumption of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,965,"infallibility in forbidding the propagation of error, than in any other"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,966,thing which is done by public authority on its own judgment and
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,967,responsibility. Judgment is given to men that they may use it. Because
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,968,"it may be used erroneously, are men to be told that they ought not to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,969,"use it at all? To prohibit what they think pernicious, is not claiming"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,970,"exemption from error, but fulfilling the duty incumbent on them,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,971,"although fallible, of acting on their conscientious conviction. If we"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,972,"were never to act on our opinions, because those opinions may be wrong,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,973,"we should leave all our interests uncared for, and all our duties"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,974,"unperformed. An objection which applies to all conduct, can be no valid"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,975,"objection to any conduct in particular. It is the duty of governments,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,976,"and of individuals, to form the truest opinions they can; to form them"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,977,"carefully, and never impose them upon others unless they are quite sure"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,978,"of being right. But when they are sure (such reasoners may say), it is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,979,not conscientiousness but cowardice to shrink from acting on their
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,980,"opinions, and allow doctrines which they honestly think dangerous to the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,981,"welfare of mankind, either in this life or in another, to be scattered"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,982,"abroad without restraint, because other people, in less enlightened"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,983,"times, have persecuted opinions now believed to be true. Let us take"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,984,"care, it may be said, not to make the same mistake: but governments and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,985,"nations have made mistakes in other things, which are not denied to be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,986,"fit subjects for the exercise of authority: they have laid on bad taxes,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,987,"made unjust wars. Ought we therefore to lay on no taxes, and, under"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,988,"whatever provocation, make no wars? Men, and governments, must act to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,989,"the best of their ability. There is no such thing as absolute certainty,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,990,but there is assurance sufficient for the purposes of human life. We
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,991,"may, and must, assume our opinion to be true for the guidance of our own"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,992,conduct: and it is assuming no more when we forbid bad men to pervert
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,993,society by the propagation of opinions which we regard as false and
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,994,pernicious.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,995,I answer that it is assuming very much more. There is the greatest
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,996,"difference between presuming an opinion to be true, because, with every"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,997,"opportunity for contesting it, it has not been refuted, and assuming its"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,998,truth for the purpose of not permitting its refutation. Complete liberty
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,999,"of contradicting and disproving our opinion, is the very condition which"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1000,justifies us in assuming its truth for purposes of action; and on no
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1001,other terms can a being with human faculties have any rational assurance
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1002,of being right.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1003,"When we consider either the history of opinion, or the ordinary conduct"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1004,"of human life, to what is it to be ascribed that the one and the other"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1005,are no worse than they are? Not certainly to the inherent force of the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1006,"human understanding; for, on any matter not self-evident, there are"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1007,"ninety-nine persons totally incapable of judging of it, for one who is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1008,capable; and the capacity of the hundredth person is only comparative;
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1009,for the majority of the eminent men of every past generation held many
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1010,"opinions now known to be erroneous, and did or approved numerous things"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1011,"which no one will now justify. Why is it, then, that there is on the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1012,whole a preponderance among mankind of rational opinions and rational
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1013,"conduct? If there really is this preponderance--which there must be,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1014,"unless human affairs are, and have always been, in an almost desperate"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1015,"state--it is owing to a quality of the human mind, the source of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1016,everything respectable in man either as an intellectual or as a moral
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1017,"being, namely, that his errors are corrigible. He is capable of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1018,"rectifying his mistakes, by discussion and experience. Not by experience"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1019,"alone. There must be discussion, to show how experience is to be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1020,interpreted. Wrong opinions and practices gradually yield to fact and
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1021,"argument: but facts and arguments, to produce any effect on the mind,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1022,must be brought before it. Very few facts are able to tell their own
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1023,"story, without comments to bring out their meaning. The whole strength"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1024,"and value, then, of human judgment, depending on the one property, that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1025,"it can be set right when it is wrong, reliance can be placed on it only"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1026,when the means of setting it right are kept constantly at hand. In the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1027,"case of any person whose judgment is really deserving of confidence, how"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1028,has it become so? Because he has kept his mind open to criticism of his
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1029,opinions and conduct. Because it has been his practice to listen to all
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1030,"that could be said against him; to profit by as much of it as was just,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1031,"and expound to himself, and upon occasion to others, the fallacy of what"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1032,"was fallacious. Because he has felt, that the only way in which a human"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1033,"being can make some approach to knowing the whole of a subject, is by"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1034,hearing what can be said about it by persons of every variety of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1035,"opinion, and studying all modes in which it can be looked at by every"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1036,character of mind. No wise man ever acquired his wisdom in any mode but
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1037,this; nor is it in the nature of human intellect to become wise in any
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1038,other manner. The steady habit of correcting and completing his own
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1039,"opinion by collating it with those of others, so far from causing doubt"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1040,"and hesitation in carrying it into practice, is the only stable"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1041,"foundation for a just reliance on it: for, being cognisant of all that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1042,"can, at least obviously, be said against him, and having taken up his"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1043,position against all gainsayers--knowing that he has sought for
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1044,"objections and difficulties, instead of avoiding them, and has shut out"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1045,no light which can be thrown upon the subject from any quarter--he has a
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1046,"right to think his judgment better than that of any person, or any"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1047,"multitude, who have not gone through a similar process."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1048,"It is not too much to require that what the wisest of mankind, those who"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1049,"are best entitled to trust their own judgment, find necessary to warrant"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1050,"their relying on it, should be submitted to by that miscellaneous"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1051,"collection of a few wise and many foolish individuals, called the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1052,"public. The most intolerant of churches, the Roman Catholic Church, even"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1053,"at the canonisation of a saint, admits, and listens patiently to, a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1054,"""devil's advocate."" The holiest of men, it appears, cannot be admitted"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1055,"to posthumous honours, until all that the devil could say against him is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1056,known and weighed. If even the Newtonian philosophy were not permitted
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1057,"to be questioned, mankind could not feel as complete assurance of its"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1058,"truth as they now do. The beliefs which we have most warrant for, have"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1059,"no safeguard to rest on, but a standing invitation to the whole world to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1060,"prove them unfounded. If the challenge is not accepted, or is accepted"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1061,"and the attempt fails, we are far enough from certainty still; but we"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1062,have done the best that the existing state of human reason admits of; we
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1063,have neglected nothing that could give the truth a chance of reaching
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1064,"us: if the lists are kept open, we may hope that if there be a better"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1065,"truth, it will be found when the human mind is capable of receiving it;"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1066,and in the meantime we may rely on having attained such approach to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1067,"truth, as is possible in our own day. This is the amount of certainty"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1068,"attainable by a fallible being, and this the sole way of attaining it."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1069,"Strange it is, that men should admit the validity of the arguments for"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1070,"free discussion, but object to their being ""pushed to an extreme;"" not"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1071,"seeing that unless the reasons are good for an extreme case, they are"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1072,not good for any case. Strange that they should imagine that they are
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1073,"not assuming infallibility, when they acknowledge that there should be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1074,"free discussion on all subjects which can possibly be _doubtful_, but"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1075,think that some particular principle or doctrine should be forbidden to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1076,"be questioned because it is _so certain_, that is, because _they are"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1077,"certain_ that it is certain. To call any proposition certain, while"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1078,"there is any one who would deny its certainty if permitted, but who is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1079,"not permitted, is to assume that we ourselves, and those who agree with"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1080,"us, are the judges of certainty, and judges without hearing the other"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1081,side.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1082,"In the present age--which has been described as ""destitute of faith, but"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1083,"terrified at scepticism""--in which people feel sure, not so much that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1084,"their opinions are true, as that they should not know what to do without"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1085,them--the claims of an opinion to be protected from public attack are
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1086,"rested not so much on its truth, as on its importance to society. There"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1087,"are, it is alleged, certain beliefs, so useful, not to say indispensable"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1088,"to well-being, that it is as much the duty of governments to uphold"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1089,"those beliefs, as to protect any other of the interests of society. In a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1090,"case of such necessity, and so directly in the line of their duty,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1091,"something less than infallibility may, it is maintained, warrant, and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1092,"even bind, governments, to act on their own opinion, confirmed by the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1093,"general opinion of mankind. It is also often argued, and still oftener"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1094,"thought, that none but bad men would desire to weaken these salutary"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1095,"beliefs; and there can be nothing wrong, it is thought, in restraining"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1096,"bad men, and prohibiting what only such men would wish to practise."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1097,This mode of thinking makes the justification of restraints on
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1098,"discussion not a question of the truth of doctrines, but of their"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1099,usefulness; and flatters itself by that means to escape the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1100,responsibility of claiming to be an infallible judge of opinions. But
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1101,"those who thus satisfy themselves, do not perceive that the assumption"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1102,of infallibility is merely shifted from one point to another. The
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1103,"usefulness of an opinion is itself matter of opinion: as disputable, as"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1104,"open to discussion, and requiring discussion as much, as the opinion"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1105,itself. There is the same need of an infallible judge of opinions to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1106,"decide an opinion to be noxious, as to decide it to be false, unless the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1107,opinion condemned has full opportunity of defending itself. And it will
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1108,not do to say that the heretic may be allowed to maintain the utility or
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1109,"harmlessness of his opinion, though forbidden to maintain its truth. The"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1110,truth of an opinion is part of its utility. If we would know whether or
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1111,"not it is desirable that a proposition should be believed, is it"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1112,possible to exclude the consideration of whether or not it is true? In
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1113,"the opinion, not of bad men, but of the best men, no belief which is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1114,contrary to truth can be really useful: and can you prevent such men
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1115,"from urging that plea, when they are charged with culpability for"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1116,"denying some doctrine which they are told is useful, but which they"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1117,"believe to be false? Those who are on the side of received opinions,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1118,never fail to take all possible advantage of this plea; you do not find
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1119,_them_ handling the question of utility as if it could be completely
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1120,"abstracted from that of truth: on the contrary, it is, above all,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1121,"because their doctrine is ""the truth,"" that the knowledge or the belief"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1122,of it is held to be so indispensable. There can be no fair discussion of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1123,"the question of usefulness, when an argument so vital may be employed on"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1124,"one side, but not on the other. And in point of fact, when law or public"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1125,"feeling do not permit the truth of an opinion to be disputed, they are"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1126,just as little tolerant of a denial of its usefulness. The utmost they
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1127,"allow is an extenuation of its absolute necessity, or of the positive"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1128,guilt of rejecting it.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1129,In order more fully to illustrate the mischief of denying a hearing to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1130,"opinions because we, in our own judgment, have condemned them, it will"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1131,be desirable to fix down the discussion to a concrete case; and I
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1132,"choose, by preference, the cases which are least favourable to me--in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1133,"which the argument against freedom of opinion, both on the score of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1134,"truth and on that of utility, is considered the strongest. Let the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1135,"opinions impugned be the belief in a God and in a future state, or any"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1136,of the commonly received doctrines of morality. To fight the battle on
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1137,"such ground, gives a great advantage to an unfair antagonist; since he"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1138,will be sure to say (and many who have no desire to be unfair will say
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1139,"it internally), Are these the doctrines which you do not deem"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1140,sufficiently certain to be taken under the protection of law? Is the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1141,"belief in a God one of the opinions, to feel sure of which, you hold to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1142,"be assuming infallibility? But I must be permitted to observe, that it"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1143,is not the feeling sure of a doctrine (be it what it may) which I call
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1144,an assumption of infallibility. It is the undertaking to decide that
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1145,"question _for others_, without allowing them to hear what can be said on"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1146,the contrary side. And I denounce and reprobate this pretension not the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1147,"less, if put forth on the side of my most solemn convictions. However"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1148,"positive any one's persuasion may be, not only of the falsity, but of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1149,"the pernicious consequences--not only of the pernicious consequences,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1150,but (to adopt expressions which I altogether condemn) the immorality and
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1151,"impiety of an opinion; yet if, in pursuance of that private judgment,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1152,though backed by the public judgment of his country or his
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1153,"contemporaries, he prevents the opinion from being heard in its defence,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1154,he assumes infallibility. And so far from the assumption being less
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1155,objectionable or less dangerous because the opinion is called immoral or
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1156,"impious, this is the case of all others in which it is most fatal. These"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1157,are exactly the occasions on which the men of one generation commit
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1158,"those dreadful mistakes, which excite the astonishment and horror of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1159,posterity. It is among such that we find the instances memorable in
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1160,"history, when the arm of the law has been employed to root out the best"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1161,"men and the noblest doctrines; with deplorable success as to the men,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1162,though some of the doctrines have survived to be (as if in mockery)
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1163,"invoked, in defence of similar conduct towards those who dissent from"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1164,"_them_, or from their received interpretation."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1165,Mankind can hardly be too often reminded that there was once a man named
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1166,"Socrates, between whom and the legal authorities and public opinion of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1167,"his time, there took place a memorable collision. Born in an age and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1168,"country abounding in individual greatness, this man has been handed down"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1169,"to us by those who best knew both him and the age, as the most virtuous"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1170,man in it; while _we_ know him as the head and prototype of all
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1171,"subsequent teachers of virtue, the source equally of the lofty"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1172,"inspiration of Plato and the judicious utilitarianism of Aristotle, ""_i"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1173,"maestri di color che sanno_,"" the two headsprings of ethical as of all"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1174,other philosophy. This acknowledged master of all the eminent thinkers
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1175,"who have since lived--whose fame, still growing after more than two"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1176,"thousand years, all but outweighs the whole remainder of the names which"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1177,"make his native city illustrious--was put to death by his countrymen,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1178,"after a judicial conviction, for impiety and immorality. Impiety, in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1179,denying the gods recognised by the State; indeed his accuser asserted
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1180,"(see the ""Apologia"") that he believed in no gods at all. Immorality, in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1181,"being, by his doctrines and instructions, a ""corruptor of youth."" Of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1182,"these charges the tribunal, there is every ground for believing,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1183,"honestly found him guilty, and condemned the man who probably of all"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1184,"then born had deserved best of mankind, to be put to death as a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1185,criminal.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1186,"To pass from this to the only other instance of judicial iniquity, the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1187,"mention of which, after the condemnation of Socrates, would not be an"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1188,anticlimax: the event which took place on Calvary rather more than
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1189,eighteen hundred years ago. The man who left on the memory of those who
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1190,"witnessed his life and conversation, such an impression of his moral"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1191,"grandeur, that eighteen subsequent centuries have done homage to him as"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1192,"the Almighty in person, was ignominiously put to death, as what? As a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1193,blasphemer. Men did not merely mistake their benefactor; they mistook
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1194,"him for the exact contrary of what he was, and treated him as that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1195,"prodigy of impiety, which they themselves are now held to be, for their"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1196,treatment of him. The feelings with which mankind now regard these
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1197,"lamentable transactions, especially the later of the two, render them"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1198,"extremely unjust in their judgment of the unhappy actors. These were, to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1199,"all appearance, not bad men--not worse than men commonly are, but rather"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1200,"the contrary; men who possessed in a full, or somewhat more than a full"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1201,"measure, the religious, moral, and patriotic feelings of their time and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1202,"people: the very kind of men who, in all times, our own included, have"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1203,every chance of passing through life blameless and respected. The
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1204,"high-priest who rent his garments when the words were pronounced, which,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1205,"according to all the ideas of his country, constituted the blackest"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1206,"guilt, was in all probability quite as sincere in his horror and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1207,"indignation, as the generality of respectable and pious men now are in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1208,the religious and moral sentiments they profess; and most of those who
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1209,"now shudder at his conduct, if they had lived in his time, and been born"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1210,"Jews, would have acted precisely as he did. Orthodox Christians who are"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1211,tempted to think that those who stoned to death the first martyrs must
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1212,"have been worse men than they themselves are, ought to remember that one"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1213,of those persecutors was Saint Paul.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1214,"Let us add one more example, the most striking of all, if the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1215,impressiveness of an error is measured by the wisdom and virtue of him
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1216,"who falls into it. If ever any one, possessed of power, had grounds for"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1217,"thinking himself the best and most enlightened among his cotemporaries,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1218,it was the Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Absolute monarch of the whole
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1219,"civilised world, he preserved through life not only the most unblemished"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1220,"justice, but what was less to be expected from his Stoical breeding, the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1221,"tenderest heart. The few failings which are attributed to him, were all"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1222,"on the side of indulgence: while his writings, the highest ethical"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1223,"product of the ancient mind, differ scarcely perceptibly, if they differ"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1224,"at all, from the most characteristic teachings of Christ. This man, a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1225,"better Christian in all but the dogmatic sense of the word, than almost"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1226,"any of the ostensibly Christian sovereigns who have since reigned,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1227,persecuted Christianity. Placed at the summit of all the previous
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1228,"attainments of humanity, with an open, unfettered intellect, and a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1229,character which led him of himself to embody in his moral writings the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1230,"Christian ideal, he yet failed to see that Christianity was to be a good"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1231,"and not an evil to the world, with his duties to which he was so deeply"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1232,penetrated. Existing society he knew to be in a deplorable state. But
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1233,"such as it was, he saw, or thought he saw, that it was held together,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1234,"and prevented from being worse, by belief and reverence of the received"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1235,"divinities. As a ruler of mankind, he deemed it his duty not to suffer"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1236,"society to fall in pieces; and saw not how, if its existing ties were"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1237,"removed, any others could be formed which could again knit it together."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1238,"The new religion openly aimed at dissolving these ties: unless,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1239,"therefore, it was his duty to adopt that religion, it seemed to be his"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1240,duty to put it down. Inasmuch then as the theology of Christianity did
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1241,not appear to him true or of divine origin; inasmuch as this strange
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1242,"history of a crucified God was not credible to him, and a system which"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1243,purported to rest entirely upon a foundation to him so wholly
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1244,"unbelievable, could not be foreseen by him to be that renovating agency"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1245,"which, after all abatements, it has in fact proved to be; the gentlest"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1246,"and most amiable of philosophers and rulers, under a solemn sense of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1247,"duty, authorised the persecution of Christianity. To my mind this is one"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1248,"of the most tragical facts in all history. It is a bitter thought, how"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1249,"different a thing the Christianity of the world might have been, if the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1250,Christian faith had been adopted as the religion of the empire under the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1251,auspices of Marcus Aurelius instead of those of Constantine. But it
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1252,"would be equally unjust to him and false to truth, to deny, that no one"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1253,"plea which can be urged for punishing anti-Christian teaching, was"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1254,"wanting to Marcus Aurelius for punishing, as he did, the propagation of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1255,"Christianity. No Christian more firmly believes that Atheism is false,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1256,"and tends to the dissolution of society, than Marcus Aurelius believed"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1257,"the same things of Christianity; he who, of all men then living, might"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1258,have been thought the most capable of appreciating it. Unless any one
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1259,"who approves of punishment for the promulgation of opinions, flatters"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1260,himself that he is a wiser and better man than Marcus Aurelius--more
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1261,"deeply versed in the wisdom of his time, more elevated in his intellect"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1262,"above it--more earnest in his search for truth, or more single-minded in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1263,his devotion to it when found;--let him abstain from that assumption of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1264,"the joint infallibility of himself and the multitude, which the great"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1265,Antoninus made with so unfortunate a result.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1266,Aware of the impossibility of defending the use of punishment for
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1267,"restraining irreligious opinions, by any argument which will not justify"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1268,"Marcus Antoninus, the enemies of religious freedom, when hard pressed,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1269,"occasionally accept this consequence, and say, with Dr. Johnson, that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1270,the persecutors of Christianity were in the right; that persecution is
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1271,"an ordeal through which truth ought to pass, and always passes"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1272,"successfully, legal penalties being, in the end, powerless against"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1273,"truth, though sometimes beneficially effective against mischievous"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1274,"errors. This is a form of the argument for religious intolerance,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1275,sufficiently remarkable not to be passed without notice.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1276,A theory which maintains that truth may justifiably be persecuted
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1277,"because persecution cannot possibly do it any harm, cannot be charged"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1278,with being intentionally hostile to the reception of new truths; but we
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1279,cannot commend the generosity of its dealing with the persons to whom
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1280,mankind are indebted for them. To discover to the world something which
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1281,"deeply concerns it, and of which it was previously ignorant; to prove to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1282,it that it had been mistaken on some vital point of temporal or
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1283,"spiritual interest, is as important a service as a human being can"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1284,"render to his fellow-creatures, and in certain cases, as in those of the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1285,"early Christians and of the Reformers, those who think with Dr. Johnson"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1286,believe it to have been the most precious gift which could be bestowed
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1287,on mankind. That the authors of such splendid benefits should be
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1288,requited by martyrdom; that their reward should be to be dealt with as
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1289,"the vilest of criminals, is not, upon this theory, a deplorable error"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1290,"and misfortune, for which humanity should mourn in sackcloth and ashes,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1291,but the normal and justifiable state of things. The propounder of a new
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1292,"truth, according to this doctrine, should stand, as stood, in the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1293,"legislation of the Locrians, the proposer of a new law, with a halter"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1294,"round his neck, to be instantly tightened if the public assembly did"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1295,"not, on hearing his reasons, then and there adopt his proposition."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1296,"People who defend this mode of treating benefactors, cannot be supposed"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1297,to set much value on the benefit; and I believe this view of the subject
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1298,is mostly confined to the sort of persons who think that new truths may
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1299,"have been desirable once, but that we have had enough of them now."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1300,"But, indeed, the dictum that truth always triumphs over persecution, is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1301,one of those pleasant falsehoods which men repeat after one another
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1302,"till they pass into commonplaces, but which all experience refutes."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1303,History teems with instances of truth put down by persecution. If not
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1304,"suppressed for ever, it may be thrown back for centuries. To speak only"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1305,of religious opinions: the Reformation broke out at least twenty times
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1306,"before Luther, and was put down. Arnold of Brescia was put down. Fra"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1307,Dolcino was put down. Savonarola was put down. The Albigeois were put
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1308,down. The Vaudois were put down. The Lollards were put down. The
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1309,"Hussites were put down. Even after the era of Luther, wherever"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1310,"persecution was persisted in, it was successful. In Spain, Italy,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1311,"Flanders, the Austrian empire, Protestantism was rooted out; and, most"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1312,"likely, would have been so in England, had Queen Mary lived, or Queen"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1313,"Elizabeth died. Persecution has always succeeded, save where the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1314,heretics were too strong a party to be effectually persecuted. No
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1315,reasonable person can doubt that Christianity might have been extirpated
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1316,"in the Roman Empire. It spread, and became predominant, because the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1317,"persecutions were only occasional, lasting but a short time, and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1318,separated by long intervals of almost undisturbed propagandism. It is a
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1319,"piece of idle sentimentality that truth, merely as truth, has any"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1320,"inherent power denied to error, of prevailing against the dungeon and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1321,the stake. Men are not more zealous for truth than they often are for
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1322,"error, and a sufficient application of legal or even of social penalties"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1323,will generally succeed in stopping the propagation of either. The real
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1324,"advantage which truth has, consists in this, that when an opinion is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1325,"true, it may be extinguished once, twice, or many times, but in the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1326,"course of ages there will generally be found persons to rediscover it,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1327,until some one of its reappearances falls on a time when from favourable
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1328,circumstances it escapes persecution until it has made such head as to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1329,withstand all subsequent attempts to suppress it.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1330,"It will be said, that we do not now put to death the introducers of new"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1331,"opinions: we are not like our fathers who slew the prophets, we even"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1332,build sepulchres to them. It is true we no longer put heretics to death;
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1333,and the amount of penal infliction which modern feeling would probably
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1334,"tolerate, even against the most obnoxious opinions, is not sufficient to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1335,extirpate them. But let us not flatter ourselves that we are yet free
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1336,"from the stain even of legal persecution. Penalties for opinion, or at"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1337,"least for its expression, still exist by law; and their enforcement is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1338,"not, even in these times, so unexampled as to make it at all incredible"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1339,"that they may some day be revived in full force. In the year 1857, at"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1340,"the summer assizes of the county of Cornwall, an unfortunate man,[7]"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1341,"said to be of unexceptionable conduct in all relations of life, was"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1342,"sentenced to twenty-one months' imprisonment, for uttering, and writing"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1343,"on a gate, some offensive words concerning Christianity. Within a month"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1344,"of the same time, at the Old Bailey, two persons, on two separate"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1345,"occasions,[8] were rejected as jurymen, and one of them grossly insulted"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1346,"by the judge and by one of the counsel, because they honestly declared"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1347,"that they had no theological belief; and a third, a foreigner,[9] for"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1348,"the same reason, was denied justice against a thief. This refusal of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1349,"redress took place in virtue of the legal doctrine, that no person can"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1350,"be allowed to give evidence in a court of justice, who does not profess"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1351,belief in a God (any god is sufficient) and in a future state; which is
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1352,"equivalent to declaring such persons to be outlaws, excluded from the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1353,protection of the tribunals; who may not only be robbed or assaulted
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1354,"with impunity, if no one but themselves, or persons of similar opinions,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1355,"be present, but any one else may be robbed or assaulted with impunity,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1356,if the proof of the fact depends on their evidence. The assumption on
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1357,"which this is grounded, is that the oath is worthless, of a person who"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1358,does not believe in a future state; a proposition which betokens much
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1359,ignorance of history in those who assent to it (since it is historically
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1360,true that a large proportion of infidels in all ages have been persons
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1361,of distinguished integrity and honour); and would be maintained by no
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1362,one who had the smallest conception how many of the persons in greatest
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1363,"repute with the world, both for virtues and for attainments, are well"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1364,"known, at least to their intimates, to be unbelievers. The rule,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1365,"besides, is suicidal, and cuts away its own foundation. Under pretence"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1366,"that atheists must be liars, it admits the testimony of all atheists who"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1367,"are willing to lie, and rejects only those who brave the obloquy of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1368,publicly confessing a detested creed rather than affirm a falsehood. A
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1369,rule thus self-convicted of absurdity so far as regards its professed
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1370,"purpose, can be kept in force only as a badge of hatred, a relic of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1371,"persecution; a persecution, too, having the peculiarity, that the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1372,"qualification for undergoing it, is the being clearly proved not to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1373,"deserve it. The rule, and the theory it implies, are hardly less"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1374,insulting to believers than to infidels. For if he who does not believe
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1375,"in a future state, necessarily lies, it follows that they who do believe"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1376,"are only prevented from lying, if prevented they are, by the fear of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1377,hell. We will not do the authors and abettors of the rule the injury of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1378,"supposing, that the conception which they have formed of Christian"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1379,virtue is drawn from their own consciousness.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1380,"These, indeed, are but rags and remnants of persecution, and may be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1381,"thought to be not so much an indication of the wish to persecute, as an"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1382,"example of that very frequent infirmity of English minds, which makes"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1383,"them take a preposterous pleasure in the assertion of a bad principle,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1384,when they are no longer bad enough to desire to carry it really into
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1385,practice. But unhappily there is no security in the state of the public
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1386,"mind, that the suspension of worse forms of legal persecution, which has"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1387,"lasted for about the space of a generation, will continue. In this age"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1388,the quiet surface of routine is as often ruffled by attempts to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1389,"resuscitate past evils, as to introduce new benefits. What is boasted of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1390,"at the present time as the revival of religion, is always, in narrow"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1391,"and uncultivated minds, at least as much the revival of bigotry; and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1392,where there is the strong permanent leaven of intolerance in the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1393,"feelings of a people, which at all times abides in the middle classes of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1394,"this country, it needs but little to provoke them into actively"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1395,persecuting those whom they have never ceased to think proper objects of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1396,"persecution.[10] For it is this--it is the opinions men entertain, and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1397,"the feelings they cherish, respecting those who disown the beliefs they"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1398,"deem important, which makes this country not a place of mental freedom."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1399,"For a long time past, the chief mischief of the legal penalties is that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1400,they strengthen the social stigma. It is that stigma which is really
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1401,"effective, and so effective is it that the profession of opinions which"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1402,"are under the ban of society is much less common in England, than is, in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1403,"many other countries, the avowal of those which incur risk of judicial"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1404,punishment. In respect to all persons but those whose pecuniary
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1405,"circumstances make them independent of the good will of other people,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1406,"opinion, on this subject, is as efficacious as law; men might as well be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1407,"imprisoned, as excluded from the means of earning their bread. Those"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1408,"whose bread is already secured, and who desire no favours from men in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1409,"power, or from bodies of men, or from the public, have nothing to fear"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1410,"from the open avowal of any opinions, but to be ill-thought of and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1411,"ill-spoken of, and this it ought not to require a very heroic mould to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1412,enable them to bear. There is no room for any appeal _ad misericordiam_
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1413,in behalf of such persons. But though we do not now inflict so much evil
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1414,"on those who think differently from us, as it was formerly our custom to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1415,"do, it may be that we do ourselves as much evil as ever by our treatment"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1416,"of them. Socrates was put to death, but the Socratic philosophy rose"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1417,"like the sun in heaven, and spread its illumination over the whole"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1418,"intellectual firmament. Christians were cast to the lions, but the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1419,"Christian church grew up a stately and spreading tree, overtopping the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1420,"older and less vigorous growths, and stifling them by its shade. Our"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1421,"merely social intolerance kills no one, roots out no opinions, but"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1422,"induces men to disguise them, or to abstain from any active effort for"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1423,"their diffusion. With us, heretical opinions do not perceptibly gain, or"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1424,"even lose, ground in each decade or generation; they never blaze out far"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1425,"and wide, but continue to smoulder in the narrow circles of thinking and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1426,"studious persons among whom they originate, without ever lighting up the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1427,general affairs of mankind with either a true or a deceptive light. And
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1428,"thus is kept up a state of things very satisfactory to some minds,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1429,"because, without the unpleasant process of fining or imprisoning"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1430,"anybody, it maintains all prevailing opinions outwardly undisturbed,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1431,while it does not absolutely interdict the exercise of reason by
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1432,dissentients afflicted with the malady of thought. A convenient plan for
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1433,"having peace in the intellectual world, and keeping all things going on"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1434,therein very much as they do already. But the price paid for this sort
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1435,"of intellectual pacification, is the sacrifice of the entire moral"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1436,courage of the human mind. A state of things in which a large portion of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1437,the most active and inquiring intellects find it advisable to keep the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1438,genuine principles and grounds of their convictions within their own
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1439,"breasts, and attempt, in what they address to the public, to fit as much"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1440,as they can of their own conclusions to premises which they have
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1441,"internally renounced, cannot send forth the open, fearless characters,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1442,"and logical, consistent intellects who once adorned the thinking world."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1443,"The sort of men who can be looked for under it, are either mere"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1444,"conformers to commonplace, or time-servers for truth, whose arguments on"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1445,"all great subjects are meant for their hearers, and are not those which"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1446,"have convinced themselves. Those who avoid this alternative, do so by"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1447,narrowing their thoughts and interest to things which can be spoken of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1448,"without venturing within the region of principles, that is, to small"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1449,"practical matters, which would come right of themselves, if but the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1450,"minds of mankind were strengthened and enlarged, and which will never be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1451,made effectually right until then: while that which would strengthen and
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1452,"enlarge men's minds, free and daring speculation on the highest"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1453,"subjects, is abandoned."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1454,"Those in whose eyes this reticence on the part of heretics is no evil,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1455,"should consider in the first place, that in consequence of it there is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1456,never any fair and thorough discussion of heretical opinions; and that
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1457,"such of them as could not stand such a discussion, though they may be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1458,"prevented from spreading, do not disappear. But it is not the minds of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1459,"heretics that are deteriorated most, by the ban placed on all inquiry"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1460,which does not end in the orthodox conclusions. The greatest harm done
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1461,"is to those who are not heretics, and whose whole mental development is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1462,"cramped, and their reason cowed, by the fear of heresy. Who can compute"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1463,what the world loses in the multitude of promising intellects combined
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1464,"with timid characters, who dare not follow out any bold, vigorous,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1465,"independent train of thought, lest it should land them in something"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1466,which would admit of being considered irreligious or immoral? Among
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1467,"them we may occasionally see some man of deep conscientiousness, and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1468,"subtle and refined understanding, who spends a life in sophisticating"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1469,"with an intellect which he cannot silence, and exhausts the resources of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1470,ingenuity in attempting to reconcile the promptings of his conscience
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1471,"and reason with orthodoxy, which yet he does not, perhaps, to the end"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1472,"succeed in doing. No one can be a great thinker who does not recognise,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1473,that as a thinker it is his first duty to follow his intellect to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1474,whatever conclusions it may lead. Truth gains more even by the errors of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1475,"one who, with due study and preparation, thinks for himself, than by the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1476,true opinions of those who only hold them because they do not suffer
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1477,"themselves to think. Not that it is solely, or chiefly, to form great"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1478,"thinkers, that freedom of thinking is required. On the contrary, it is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1479,"as much, and even more indispensable, to enable average human beings to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1480,"attain the mental stature which they are capable of. There have been,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1481,"and may again be, great individual thinkers, in a general atmosphere of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1482,"mental slavery. But there never has been, nor ever will be, in that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1483,"atmosphere, an intellectually active people. Where any people has made a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1484,"temporary approach to such a character, it has been because the dread"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1485,of heterodox speculation was for a time suspended. Where there is a
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1486,tacit convention that principles are not to be disputed; where the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1487,discussion of the greatest questions which can occupy humanity is
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1488,"considered to be closed, we cannot hope to find that generally high"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1489,scale of mental activity which has made some periods of history so
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1490,remarkable. Never when controversy avoided the subjects which are large
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1491,"and important enough to kindle enthusiasm, was the mind of a people"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1492,"stirred up from its foundations, and the impulse given which raised even"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1493,persons of the most ordinary intellect to something of the dignity of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1494,thinking beings. Of such we have had an example in the condition of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1495,"Europe during the times immediately following the Reformation; another,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1496,"though limited to the Continent and to a more cultivated class, in the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1497,speculative movement of the latter half of the eighteenth century; and a
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1498,"third, of still briefer duration, in the intellectual fermentation of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1499,Germany during the Goethian and Fichtean period. These periods differed
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1500,widely in the particular opinions which they developed; but were alike
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1501,"in this, that during all three the yoke of authority was broken. In"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1502,"each, an old mental despotism had been thrown off, and no new one had"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1503,yet taken its place. The impulse given at these three periods has made
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1504,Europe what it now is. Every single improvement which has taken place
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1505,"either in the human mind or in institutions, may be traced distinctly to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1506,one or other of them. Appearances have for some time indicated that all
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1507,"three impulses are well-nigh spent; and we can expect no fresh start,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1508,until we again assert our mental freedom.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1509,"Let us now pass to the second division of the argument, and dismissing"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1510,"the supposition that any of the received opinions may be false, let us"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1511,"assume them to be true, and examine into the worth of the manner in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1512,"which they are likely to be held, when their truth is not freely and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1513,openly canvassed. However unwillingly a person who has a strong opinion
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1514,"may admit the possibility that his opinion may be false, he ought to be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1515,"moved by the consideration that however true it may be, if it is not"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1516,"fully, frequently, and fearlessly discussed, it will be held as a dead"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1517,"dogma, not a living truth."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1518,There is a class of persons (happily not quite so numerous as formerly)
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1519,who think it enough if a person assents undoubtingly to what they think
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1520,"true, though he has no knowledge whatever of the grounds of the opinion,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1521,and could not make a tenable defence of it against the most superficial
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1522,"objections. Such persons, if they can once get their creed taught from"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1523,"authority, naturally think that no good, and some harm, comes of its"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1524,"being allowed to be questioned. Where their influence prevails, they"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1525,make it nearly impossible for the received opinion to be rejected wisely
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1526,"and considerately, though it may still be rejected rashly and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1527,"ignorantly; for to shut out discussion entirely is seldom possible, and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1528,"when it once gets in, beliefs not grounded on conviction are apt to give"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1529,"way before the slightest semblance of an argument. Waiving, however,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1530,"this possibility--assuming that the true opinion abides in the mind, but"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1531,"abides as a prejudice, a belief independent of, and proof against,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1532,argument--this is not the way in which truth ought to be held by a
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1533,"rational being. This is not knowing the truth. Truth, thus held, is but"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1534,"one superstition the more, accidentally clinging to the words which"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1535,enunciate a truth.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1536,"If the intellect and judgment of mankind ought to be cultivated, a thing"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1537,"which Protestants at least do not deny, on what can these faculties be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1538,"more appropriately exercised by any one, than on the things which"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1539,concern him so much that it is considered necessary for him to hold
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1540,opinions on them? If the cultivation of the understanding consists in
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1541,"one thing more than in another, it is surely in learning the grounds of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1542,"one's own opinions. Whatever people believe, on subjects on which it is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1543,"of the first importance to believe rightly, they ought to be able to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1544,"defend against at least the common objections. But, some one may say,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1545,"""Let them be _taught_ the grounds of their opinions. It does not follow"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1546,that opinions must be merely parroted because they are never heard
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1547,controverted. Persons who learn geometry do not simply commit the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1548,"theorems to memory, but understand and learn likewise the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1549,demonstrations; and it would be absurd to say that they remain ignorant
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1550,"of the grounds of geometrical truths, because they never hear any one"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1551,"deny, and attempt to disprove them."" Undoubtedly: and such teaching"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1552,"suffices on a subject like mathematics, where there is nothing at all to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1553,be said on the wrong side of the question. The peculiarity of the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1554,"evidence of mathematical truths is, that all the argument is on one"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1555,"side. There are no objections, and no answers to objections. But on"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1556,"every subject on which difference of opinion is possible, the truth"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1557,depends on a balance to be struck between two sets of conflicting
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1558,"reasons. Even in natural philosophy, there is always some other"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1559,explanation possible of the same facts; some geocentric theory instead
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1560,"of heliocentric, some phlogiston instead of oxygen; and it has to be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1561,shown why that other theory cannot be the true one: and until this is
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1562,"shown, and until we know how it is shown, we do not understand the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1563,grounds of our opinion. But when we turn to subjects infinitely more
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1564,"complicated, to morals, religion, politics, social relations, and the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1565,"business of life, three-fourths of the arguments for every disputed"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1566,opinion consist in dispelling the appearances which favour some opinion
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1567,"different from it. The greatest orator, save one, of antiquity, has left"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1568,"it on record that he always studied his adversary's case with as great,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1569,"if not with still greater, intensity than even his own. What Cicero"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1570,"practised as the means of forensic success, requires to be imitated by"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1571,all who study any subject in order to arrive at the truth. He who knows
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1572,"only his own side of the case, knows little of that. His reasons may be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1573,"good, and no one may have been able to refute them. But if he is equally"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1574,unable to refute the reasons on the opposite side; if he does not so
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1575,"much as know what they are, he has no ground for preferring either"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1576,"opinion. The rational position for him would be suspension of judgment,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1577,"and unless he contents himself with that, he is either led by"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1578,"authority, or adopts, like the generality of the world, the side to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1579,which he feels most inclination. Nor is it enough that he should hear
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1580,"the arguments of adversaries from his own teachers, presented as they"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1581,"state them, and accompanied by what they offer as refutations. That is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1582,"not the way to do justice to the arguments, or bring them into real"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1583,contact with his own mind. He must be able to hear them from persons who
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1584,"actually believe them; who defend them in earnest, and do their very"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1585,utmost for them. He must know them in their most plausible and
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1586,persuasive form; he must feel the whole force of the difficulty which
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1587,the true view of the subject has to encounter and dispose of; else he
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1588,will never really possess himself of the portion of truth which meets
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1589,and removes that difficulty. Ninety-nine in a hundred of what are called
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1590,educated men are in this condition; even of those who can argue fluently
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1591,"for their opinions. Their conclusion may be true, but it might be false"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1592,for anything they know: they have never thrown themselves into the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1593,"mental position of those who think differently from them, and considered"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1594,"what such persons may have to say; and consequently they do not, in any"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1595,"proper sense of the word, know the doctrine which they themselves"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1596,profess. They do not know those parts of it which explain and justify
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1597,the remainder; the considerations which show that a fact which seemingly
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1598,"conflicts with another is reconcilable with it, or that, of two"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1599,"apparently strong reasons, one and not the other ought to be preferred."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1600,"All that part of the truth which turns the scale, and decides the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1601,"judgment of a completely informed mind, they are strangers to; nor is it"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1602,"ever really known, but to those who have attended equally and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1603,"impartially to both sides, and endeavoured to see the reasons of both in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1604,the strongest light. So essential is this discipline to a real
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1605,"understanding of moral and human subjects, that if opponents of all"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1606,"important truths do not exist, it is indispensable to imagine them, and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1607,supply them with the strongest arguments which the most skilful devil's
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1608,advocate can conjure up.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1609,"To abate the force of these considerations, an enemy of free discussion"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1610,"may be supposed to say, that there is no necessity for mankind in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1611,general to know and understand all that can be said against or for their
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1612,opinions by philosophers and theologians. That it is not needful for
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1613,common men to be able to expose all the misstatements or fallacies of an
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1614,ingenious opponent. That it is enough if there is always somebody
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1615,"capable of answering them, so that nothing likely to mislead"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1616,"uninstructed persons remains unrefuted. That simple minds, having been"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1617,"taught the obvious grounds of the truths inculcated on them, may trust"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1618,"to authority for the rest, and being aware that they have neither"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1619,"knowledge nor talent to resolve every difficulty which can be raised,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1620,may repose in the assurance that all those which have been raised have
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1621,"been or can be answered, by those who are specially trained to the task."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1622,Conceding to this view of the subject the utmost that can be claimed for
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1623,it by those most easily satisfied with the amount of understanding of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1624,"truth which ought to accompany the belief of it; even so, the argument"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1625,for free discussion is no way weakened. For even this doctrine
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1626,acknowledges that mankind ought to have a rational assurance that all
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1627,objections have been satisfactorily answered; and how are they to be
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1628,answered if that which requires to be answered is not spoken? or how can
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1629,"the answer be known to be satisfactory, if the objectors have no"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1630,"opportunity of showing that it is unsatisfactory? If not the public, at"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1631,least the philosophers and theologians who are to resolve the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1632,"difficulties, must make themselves familiar with those difficulties in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1633,their most puzzling form; and this cannot be accomplished unless they
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1634,"are freely stated, and placed in the most advantageous light which they"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1635,admit of. The Catholic Church has its own way of dealing with this
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1636,embarrassing problem. It makes a broad separation between those who can
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1637,"be permitted to receive its doctrines on conviction, and those who must"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1638,"accept them on trust. Neither, indeed, are allowed any choice as to what"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1639,"they will accept; but the clergy, such at least as can be fully confided"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1640,"in, may admissibly and meritoriously make themselves acquainted with the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1641,"arguments of opponents, in order to answer them, and may, therefore,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1642,"read heretical books; the laity, not unless by special permission, hard"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1643,to be obtained. This discipline recognises a knowledge of the enemy's
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1644,"case as beneficial to the teachers, but finds means, consistent with"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1645,"this, of denying it to the rest of the world: thus giving to the _elite_"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1646,"more mental culture, though not more mental freedom, than it allows to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1647,the mass. By this device it succeeds in obtaining the kind of mental
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1648,superiority which its purposes require; for though culture without
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1649,"freedom never made a large and liberal mind, it can make a clever _nisi"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1650,"prius_ advocate of a cause. But in countries professing Protestantism,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1651,"this resource is denied; since Protestants hold, at least in theory,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1652,that the responsibility for the choice of a religion must be borne by
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1653,"each for himself, and cannot be thrown off upon teachers. Besides, in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1654,"the present state of the world, it is practically impossible that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1655,writings which are read by the instructed can be kept from the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1656,uninstructed. If the teachers of mankind are to be cognisant of all that
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1657,"they ought to know, everything must be free to be written and published"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1658,without restraint.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1659,"If, however, the mischievous operation of the absence of free"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1660,"discussion, when the received opinions are true, were confined to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1661,"leaving men ignorant of the grounds of those opinions, it might be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1662,"thought that this, if an intellectual, is no moral evil, and does not"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1663,"affect the worth of the opinions, regarded in their influence on the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1664,"character. The fact, however, is, that not only the grounds of the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1665,"opinion are forgotten in the absence of discussion, but too often the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1666,"meaning of the opinion itself. The words which convey it, cease to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1667,"suggest ideas, or suggest only a small portion of those they were"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1668,originally employed to communicate. Instead of a vivid conception and a
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1669,"living belief, there remain only a few phrases retained by rote; or, if"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1670,"any part, the shell and husk only of the meaning is retained, the finer"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1671,essence being lost. The great chapter in human history which this fact
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1672,"occupies and fills, cannot be too earnestly studied and meditated on."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1673,It is illustrated in the experience of almost all ethical doctrines and
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1674,religious creeds. They are all full of meaning and vitality to those who
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1675,"originate them, and to the direct disciples of the originators. Their"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1676,"meaning continues to be felt in undiminished strength, and is perhaps"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1677,"brought out into even fuller consciousness, so long as the struggle"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1678,lasts to give the doctrine or creed an ascendency over other creeds. At
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1679,"last it either prevails, and becomes the general opinion, or its"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1680,"progress stops; it keeps possession of the ground it has gained, but"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1681,ceases to spread further. When either of these results has become
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1682,"apparent, controversy on the subject flags, and gradually dies away. The"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1683,"doctrine has taken its place, if not as a received opinion, as one of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1684,the admitted sects or divisions of opinion: those who hold it have
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1685,"generally inherited, not adopted it; and conversion from one of these"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1686,"doctrines to another, being now an exceptional fact, occupies little"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1687,"place in the thoughts of their professors. Instead of being, as at"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1688,"first, constantly on the alert either to defend themselves against the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1689,"world, or to bring the world over to them, they have subsided into"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1690,"acquiescence, and neither listen, when they can help it, to arguments"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1691,"against their creed, nor trouble dissentients (if there be such) with"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1692,arguments in its favour. From this time may usually be dated the decline
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1693,in the living power of the doctrine. We often hear the teachers of all
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1694,creeds lamenting the difficulty of keeping up in the minds of believers
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1695,"a lively apprehension of the truth which they nominally recognise, so"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1696,"that it may penetrate the feelings, and acquire a real mastery over the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1697,conduct. No such difficulty is complained of while the creed is still
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1698,fighting for its existence: even the weaker combatants then know and
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1699,"feel what they are fighting for, and the difference between it and other"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1700,"doctrines; and in that period of every creed's existence, not a few"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1701,"persons may be found, who have realised its fundamental principles in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1702,"all the forms of thought, have weighed and considered them in all their"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1703,"important bearings, and have experienced the full effect on the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1704,"character, which belief in that creed ought to produce in a mind"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1705,thoroughly imbued with it. But when it has come to be a hereditary
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1706,"creed, and to be received passively, not actively--when the mind is no"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1707,"longer compelled, in the same degree as at first, to exercise its vital"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1708,"powers on the questions which its belief presents to it, there is a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1709,progressive tendency to forget all of the belief except the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1710,"formularies, or to give it a dull and torpid assent, as if accepting it"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1711,"on trust dispensed with the necessity of realising it in consciousness,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1712,or testing it by personal experience; until it almost ceases to connect
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1713,itself at all with the inner life of the human being. Then are seen the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1714,"cases, so frequent in this age of the world as almost to form the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1715,"majority, in which the creed remains as it were outside the mind,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1716,encrusting and petrifying it against all other influences addressed to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1717,the higher parts of our nature; manifesting its power by not suffering
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1718,"any fresh and living conviction to get in, but itself doing nothing for"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1719,"the mind or heart, except standing sentinel over them to keep them"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1720,vacant.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1721,To what an extent doctrines intrinsically fitted to make the deepest
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1722,"impression upon the mind may remain in it as dead beliefs, without being"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1723,"ever realised in the imagination, the feelings, or the understanding, is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1724,exemplified by the manner in which the majority of believers hold the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1725,doctrines of Christianity. By Christianity I here mean what is accounted
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1726,such by all churches and sects--the maxims and precepts contained in the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1727,"New Testament. These are considered sacred, and accepted as laws, by all"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1728,professing Christians. Yet it is scarcely too much to say that not one
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1729,Christian in a thousand guides or tests his individual conduct by
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1730,"reference to those laws. The standard to which he does refer it, is the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1731,"custom of his nation, his class, or his religious profession. He has"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1732,"thus, on the one hand, a collection of ethical maxims, which he believes"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1733,to have been vouchsafed to him by infallible wisdom as rules for his
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1734,"government; and on the other, a set of every-day judgments and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1735,"practices, which go a certain length with some of those maxims, not so"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1736,"great a length with others, stand in direct opposition to some, and are,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1737,"on the whole, a compromise between the Christian creed and the interests"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1738,and suggestions of worldly life. To the first of these standards he
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1739,gives his homage; to the other his real allegiance. All Christians
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1740,"believe that the blessed are the poor and humble, and those who are"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1741,ill-used by the world; that it is easier for a camel to pass through the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1742,eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven; that
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1743,"they should judge not, lest they be judged; that they should swear not"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1744,at all; that they should love their neighbour as themselves; that if one
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1745,"take their cloak, they should give him their coat also; that they should"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1746,"take no thought for the morrow; that if they would be perfect, they"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1747,should sell all that they have and give it to the poor. They are not
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1748,insincere when they say that they believe these things. They do believe
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1749,"them, as people believe what they have always heard lauded and never"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1750,discussed. But in the sense of that living belief which regulates
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1751,"conduct, they believe these doctrines just up to the point to which it"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1752,is usual to act upon them. The doctrines in their integrity are
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1753,serviceable to pelt adversaries with; and it is understood that they are
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1754,to be put forward (when possible) as the reasons for whatever people do
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1755,that they think laudable. But any one who reminded them that the maxims
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1756,"require an infinity of things which they never even think of doing,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1757,would gain nothing but to be classed among those very unpopular
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1758,characters who affect to be better than other people. The doctrines have
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1759,no hold on ordinary believers--are not a power in their minds. They have
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1760,"a habitual respect for the sound of them, but no feeling which spreads"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1761,"from the words to the things signified, and forces the mind to take"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1762,"_them_ in, and make them conform to the formula. Whenever conduct is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1763,"concerned, they look round for Mr. A and B to direct them how far to go"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1764,in obeying Christ.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1765,"Now we may be well assured that the case was not thus, but far"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1766,"otherwise, with the early Christians. Had it been thus, Christianity"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1767,never would have expanded from an obscure sect of the despised Hebrews
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1768,"into the religion of the Roman empire. When their enemies said, ""See how"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1769,"these Christians love one another"" (a remark not likely to be made by"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1770,"anybody now), they assuredly had a much livelier feeling of the meaning"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1771,"of their creed than they have ever had since. And to this cause,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1772,"probably, it is chiefly owing that Christianity now makes so little"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1773,"progress in extending its domain, and after eighteen centuries, is still"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1774,nearly confined to Europeans and the descendants of Europeans. Even with
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1775,"the strictly religious, who are much in earnest about their doctrines,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1776,and attach a greater amount of meaning to many of them than people in
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1777,"general, it commonly happens that the part which is thus comparatively"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1778,"active in their minds is that which was made by Calvin, or Knox, or some"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1779,such person much nearer in character to themselves. The sayings of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1780,"Christ coexist passively in their minds, producing hardly any effect"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1781,beyond what is caused by mere listening to words so amiable and bland.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1782,"There are many reasons, doubtless, why doctrines which are the badge of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1783,a sect retain more of their vitality than those common to all recognised
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1784,"sects, and why more pains are taken by teachers to keep their meaning"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1785,"alive; but one reason certainly is, that the peculiar doctrines are more"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1786,"questioned, and have to be oftener defended against open gainsayers."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1787,"Both teachers and learners go to sleep at their post, as soon as there"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1788,is no enemy in the field.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1789,"The same thing holds true, generally speaking, of all traditional"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1790,"doctrines--those of prudence and knowledge of life, as well as of morals"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1791,or religion. All languages and literatures are full of general
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1792,"observations on life, both as to what it is, and how to conduct oneself"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1793,"in it; observations which everybody knows, which everybody repeats, or"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1794,"hears with acquiescence, which are received as truisms, yet of which"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1795,"most people first truly learn the meaning, when experience, generally of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1796,"a painful kind, has made it a reality to them. How often, when smarting"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1797,"under some unforeseen misfortune or disappointment, does a person call"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1798,"to mind some proverb or common saying, familiar to him all his life, the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1799,"meaning of which, if he had ever before felt it as he does now, would"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1800,"have saved him from the calamity. There are indeed reasons for this,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1801,other than the absence of discussion: there are many truths of which the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1802,"full meaning _cannot_ be realised, until personal experience has brought"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1803,it home. But much more of the meaning even of these would have been
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1804,"understood, and what was understood would have been far more deeply"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1805,"impressed on the mind, if the man had been accustomed to hear it argued"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1806,_pro_ and _con_ by people who did understand it. The fatal tendency of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1807,mankind to leave off thinking about a thing when it is no longer
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1808,"doubtful, is the cause of half their errors. A contemporary author has"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1809,"well spoken of ""the deep slumber of a decided opinion."""
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1810,But what! (it may be asked) Is the absence of unanimity an indispensable
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1811,condition of true knowledge? Is it necessary that some part of mankind
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1812,"should persist in error, to enable any to realise the truth? Does a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1813,belief cease to be real and vital as soon as it is generally
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1814,received--and is a proposition never thoroughly understood and felt
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1815,unless some doubt of it remains? As soon as mankind have unanimously
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1816,"accepted a truth, does the truth perish within them? The highest aim and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1817,"best result of improved intelligence, it has hitherto been thought, is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1818,to unite mankind more and more in the acknowledgment of all important
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1819,truths: and does the intelligence only last as long as it has not
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1820,achieved its object? Do the fruits of conquest perish by the very
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1821,completeness of the victory?
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1822,"I affirm no such thing. As mankind improve, the number of doctrines"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1823,which are no longer disputed or doubted will be constantly on the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1824,increase: and the well-being of mankind may almost be measured by the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1825,number and gravity of the truths which have reached the point of being
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1826,"uncontested. The cessation, on one question after another, of serious"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1827,"controversy, is one of the necessary incidents of the consolidation of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1828,"opinion; a consolidation as salutary in the case of true opinions, as it"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1829,is dangerous and noxious when the opinions are erroneous. But though
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1830,this gradual narrowing of the bounds of diversity of opinion is
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1831,"necessary in both senses of the term, being at once inevitable and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1832,"indispensable, we are not therefore obliged to conclude that all its"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1833,consequences must be beneficial. The loss of so important an aid to the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1834,"intelligent and living apprehension of a truth, as is afforded by the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1835,"necessity of explaining it to, or defending it against, opponents,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1836,"though not sufficient to outweigh, is no trifling drawback from, the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1837,benefit of its universal recognition. Where this advantage can no longer
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1838,"be had, I confess I should like to see the teachers of mankind"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1839,endeavouring to provide a substitute for it; some contrivance for making
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1840,the difficulties of the question as present to the learner's
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1841,"consciousness, as if they were pressed upon him by a dissentient"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1842,"champion, eager for his conversion."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1843,"But instead of seeking contrivances for this purpose, they have lost"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1844,"those they formerly had. The Socratic dialectics, so magnificently"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1845,"exemplified in the dialogues of Plato, were a contrivance of this"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1846,description. They were essentially a negative discussion of the great
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1847,"questions of philosophy and life, directed with consummate skill to the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1848,purpose of convincing any one who had merely adopted the commonplaces of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1849,"received opinion, that he did not understand the subject--that he as yet"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1850,attached no definite meaning to the doctrines he professed; in order
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1851,"that, becoming aware of his ignorance, he might be put in the way to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1852,"attain a stable belief, resting on a clear apprehension both of the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1853,meaning of doctrines and of their evidence. The school disputations of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1854,the middle ages had a somewhat similar object. They were intended to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1855,"make sure that the pupil understood his own opinion, and (by necessary"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1856,"correlation) the opinion opposed to it, and could enforce the grounds of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1857,the one and confute those of the other. These last-mentioned contests
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1858,"had indeed the incurable defect, that the premises appealed to were"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1859,"taken from authority, not from reason; and, as a discipline to the mind,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1860,they were in every respect inferior to the powerful dialectics which
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1861,"formed the intellects of the ""Socratici viri"": but the modern mind owes"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1862,"far more to both than it is generally willing to admit, and the present"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1863,modes of education contain nothing which in the smallest degree supplies
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1864,the place either of the one or of the other. A person who derives all
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1865,"his instruction from teachers or books, even if he escape the besetting"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1866,"temptation of contenting himself with cram, is under no compulsion to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1867,"hear both sides; accordingly it is far from a frequent accomplishment,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1868,"even among thinkers, to know both sides; and the weakest part of what"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1869,"everybody says in defence of his opinion, is what he intends as a reply"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1870,to antagonists. It is the fashion of the present time to disparage
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1871,negative logic--that which points out weaknesses in theory or errors in
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1872,"practice, without establishing positive truths. Such negative criticism"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1873,would indeed be poor enough as an ultimate result; but as a means to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1874,"attaining any positive knowledge or conviction worthy the name, it"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1875,cannot be valued too highly; and until people are again systematically
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1876,"trained to it, there will be few great thinkers, and a low general"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1877,"average of intellect, in any but the mathematical and physical"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1878,departments of speculation. On any other subject no one's opinions
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1879,"deserve the name of knowledge, except so far as he has either had"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1880,"forced upon him by others, or gone through of himself, the same mental"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1881,process which would have been required of him in carrying on an active
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1882,"controversy with opponents. That, therefore, which when absent, it is so"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1883,"indispensable, but so difficult, to create, how worse than absurd is it"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1884,"to forego, when spontaneously offering itself! If there are any persons"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1885,"who contest a received opinion, or who will do so if law or opinion will"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1886,"let them, let us thank them for it, open our minds to listen to them,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1887,"and rejoice that there is some one to do for us what we otherwise ought,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1888,if we have any regard for either the certainty or the vitality of our
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1889,"convictions, to do with much greater labour for ourselves."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1890,It still remains to speak of one of the principal causes which make
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1891,"diversity of opinion advantageous, and will continue to do so until"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1892,mankind shall have entered a stage of intellectual advancement which at
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1893,present seems at an incalculable distance. We have hitherto considered
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1894,"only two possibilities: that the received opinion may be false, and some"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1895,"other opinion, consequently, true; or that, the received opinion being"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1896,"true, a conflict with the opposite error is essential to a clear"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1897,apprehension and deep feeling of its truth. But there is a commoner
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1898,"case than either of these; when the conflicting doctrines, instead of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1899,"being one true and the other false, share the truth between them; and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1900,the nonconforming opinion is needed to supply the remainder of the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1901,"truth, of which the received doctrine embodies only a part. Popular"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1902,"opinions, on subjects not palpable to sense, are often true, but seldom"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1903,or never the whole truth. They are a part of the truth; sometimes a
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1904,"greater, sometimes a smaller part, but exaggerated, distorted, and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1905,disjoined from the truths by which they ought to be accompanied and
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1906,"limited. Heretical opinions, on the other hand, are generally some of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1907,"these suppressed and neglected truths, bursting the bonds which kept"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1908,"them down, and either seeking reconciliation with the truth contained in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1909,"the common opinion, or fronting it as enemies, and setting themselves"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1910,"up, with similar exclusiveness, as the whole truth. The latter case is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1911,"hitherto the most frequent, as, in the human mind, one-sidedness has"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1912,"always been the rule, and many-sidedness the exception. Hence, even in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1913,"revolutions of opinion, one part of the truth usually sets while another"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1914,"rises. Even progress, which ought to superadd, for the most part only"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1915,substitutes one partial and incomplete truth for another; improvement
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1916,"consisting chiefly in this, that the new fragment of truth is more"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1917,"wanted, more adapted to the needs of the time, than that which it"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1918,"displaces. Such being the partial character of prevailing opinions, even"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1919,when resting on a true foundation; every opinion which embodies somewhat
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1920,"of the portion of truth which the common opinion omits, ought to be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1921,"considered precious, with whatever amount of error and confusion that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1922,truth may be blended. No sober judge of human affairs will feel bound to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1923,be indignant because those who force on our notice truths which we
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1924,"should otherwise have overlooked, overlook some of those which we see."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1925,"Rather, he will think that so long as popular truth is one-sided, it is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1926,more desirable than otherwise that unpopular truth should have one-sided
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1927,"asserters too; such being usually the most energetic, and the most"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1928,likely to compel reluctant attention to the fragment of wisdom which
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1929,they proclaim as if it were the whole.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1930,"Thus, in the eighteenth century, when nearly all the instructed, and all"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1931,"those of the uninstructed who were led by them, were lost in admiration"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1932,"of what is called civilisation, and of the marvels of modern science,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1933,"literature, and philosophy, and while greatly overrating the amount of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1934,"unlikeness between the men of modern and those of ancient times,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1935,indulged the belief that the whole of the difference was in their own
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1936,favour; with what a salutary shock did the paradoxes of Rousseau explode
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1937,"like bombshells in the midst, dislocating the compact mass of one-sided"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1938,"opinion, and forcing its elements to recombine in a better form and with"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1939,additional ingredients. Not that the current opinions were on the whole
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1940,"farther from the truth than Rousseau's were; on the contrary, they were"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1941,"nearer to it; they contained more of positive truth, and very much less"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1942,"of error. Nevertheless there lay in Rousseau's doctrine, and has floated"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1943,"down the stream of opinion along with it, a considerable amount of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1944,exactly those truths which the popular opinion wanted; and these are the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1945,deposit which was left behind when the flood subsided. The superior
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1946,"worth of simplicity of life, the enervating and demoralising effect of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1947,"the trammels and hypocrisies of artificial society, are ideas which have"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1948,never been entirely absent from cultivated minds since Rousseau wrote;
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1949,"and they will in time produce their due effect, though at present"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1950,"needing to be asserted as much as ever, and to be asserted by deeds, for"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1951,"words, on this subject, have nearly exhausted their power."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1952,"In politics, again, it is almost a commonplace, that a party of order"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1953,"or stability, and a party of progress or reform, are both necessary"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1954,elements of a healthy state of political life; until the one or the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1955,other shall have so enlarged its mental grasp as to be a party equally
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1956,"of order and of progress, knowing and distinguishing what is fit to be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1957,preserved from what ought to be swept away. Each of these modes of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1958,thinking derives its utility from the deficiencies of the other; but it
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1959,is in a great measure the opposition of the other that keeps each within
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1960,the limits of reason and sanity. Unless opinions favourable to democracy
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1961,"and to aristocracy, to property and to equality, to co-operation and to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1962,"competition, to luxury and to abstinence, to sociality and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1963,"individuality, to liberty and discipline, and all the other standing"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1964,"antagonisms of practical life, are expressed with equal freedom, and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1965,"enforced and defended with equal talent and energy, there is no chance"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1966,of both elements obtaining their due; one scale is sure to go up and the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1967,"other down. Truth, in the great practical concerns of life, is so much a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1968,"question of the reconciling and combining of opposites, that very few"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1969,have minds sufficiently capacious and impartial to make the adjustment
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1970,"with an approach to correctness, and it has to be made by the rough"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1971,process of a struggle between combatants fighting under hostile
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1972,"banners. On any of the great open questions just enumerated, if either"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1973,"of the two opinions has a better claim than the other, not merely to be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1974,"tolerated, but to be encouraged and countenanced, it is the one which"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1975,happens at the particular time and place to be in a minority. That is
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1976,"the opinion which, for the time being, represents the neglected"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1977,"interests, the side of human well-being which is in danger of obtaining"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1978,"less than its share. I am aware that there is not, in this country, any"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1979,intolerance of differences of opinion on most of these topics. They are
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1980,"adduced to show, by admitted and multiplied examples, the universality"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1981,"of the fact, that only through diversity of opinion is there, in the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1982,"existing state of human intellect, a chance of fair-play to all sides of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1983,"the truth. When there are persons to be found, who form an exception to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1984,"the apparent unanimity of the world on any subject, even if the world is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1985,"in the right, it is always probable that dissentients have something"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1986,"worth hearing to say for themselves, and that truth would lose something"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1987,by their silence.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1988,"It may be objected, ""But _some_ received principles, especially on the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1989,"highest and most vital subjects, are more than half-truths. The"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1990,"Christian morality, for instance, is the whole truth on that subject,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1991,"and if any one teaches a morality which varies from it, he is wholly in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1992,"error."" As this is of all cases the most important in practice, none can"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1993,be fitter to test the general maxim. But before pronouncing what
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1994,"Christian morality is or is not, it would be desirable to decide what is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1995,meant by Christian morality. If it means the morality of the New
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1996,"Testament, I wonder that any one who derives his knowledge of this from"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1997,"the book itself, can suppose that it was announced, or intended, as a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1998,complete doctrine of morals. The Gospel always refers to a pre-existing
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,1999,"morality, and confines its precepts to the particulars in which that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2000,"morality was to be corrected, or superseded by a wider and higher;"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2001,"expressing itself, moreover, in terms most general, often impossible to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2002,"be interpreted literally, and possessing rather the impressiveness of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2003,poetry or eloquence than the precision of legislation. To extract from
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2004,"it a body of ethical doctrine, has ever been possible without eking it"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2005,"out from the Old Testament, that is, from a system elaborate indeed, but"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2006,"in many respects barbarous, and intended only for a barbarous people."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2007,"St. Paul, a declared enemy to this Judaical mode of interpreting the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2008,"doctrine and filling up the scheme of his Master, equally assumes a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2009,"pre-existing morality, namely, that of the Greeks and Romans; and his"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2010,advice to Christians is in a great measure a system of accommodation to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2011,that; even to the extent of giving an apparent sanction to slavery. What
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2012,"is called Christian, but should rather be termed theological, morality,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2013,"was not the work of Christ or the Apostles, but is of much later origin,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2014,having been gradually built up by the Catholic church of the first five
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2015,"centuries, and though not implicitly adopted by moderns and Protestants,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2016,has been much less modified by them than might have been expected. For
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2017,"the most part, indeed, they have contented themselves with cutting off"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2018,"the additions which had been made to it in the middle ages, each sect"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2019,"supplying the place by fresh additions, adapted to its own character and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2020,"tendencies. That mankind owe a great debt to this morality, and to its"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2021,"early teachers, I should be the last person to deny; but I do not"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2022,"scruple to say of it, that it is, in many important points, incomplete"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2023,"and one-sided, and that unless ideas and feelings, not sanctioned by it,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2024,"had contributed to the formation of European life and character, human"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2025,affairs would have been in a worse condition than they now are.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2026,Christian morality (so called) has all the characters of a reaction; it
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2027,"is, in great part, a protest against Paganism. Its ideal is negative"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2028,rather than positive; passive rather than active; Innocence rather than
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2029,"Nobleness; Abstinence from Evil, rather than energetic Pursuit of Good:"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2030,"in its precepts (as has been well said) ""thou shalt not"" predominates"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2031,"unduly over ""thou shalt."" In its horror of sensuality, it made an idol"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2032,"of asceticism, which has been gradually compromised away into one of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2033,"legality. It holds out the hope of heaven and the threat of hell, as the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2034,appointed and appropriate motives to a virtuous life: in this falling
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2035,"far below the best of the ancients, and doing what lies in it to give to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2036,"human morality an essentially selfish character, by disconnecting each"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2037,"man's feelings of duty from the interests of his fellow-creatures,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2038,except so far as a self-interested inducement is offered to him for
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2039,consulting them. It is essentially a doctrine of passive obedience; it
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2040,inculcates submission to all authorities found established; who indeed
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2041,"are not to be actively obeyed when they command what religion forbids,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2042,"but who are not to be resisted, far less rebelled against, for any"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2043,"amount of wrong to ourselves. And while, in the morality of the best"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2044,"Pagan nations, duty to the State holds even a disproportionate place,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2045,infringing on the just liberty of the individual; in purely Christian
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2046,"ethics, that grand department of duty is scarcely noticed or"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2047,"acknowledged. It is in the Koran, not the New Testament, that we read"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2048,"the maxim--""A ruler who appoints any man to an office, when there is in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2049,"his dominions another man better qualified for it, sins against God and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2050,"against the State."" What little recognition the idea of obligation to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2051,"the public obtains in modern morality, is derived from Greek and Roman"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2052,"sources, not from Christian; as, even in the morality of private life,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2053,"whatever exists of magnanimity, high-mindedness, personal dignity, even"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2054,"the sense of honour, is derived from the purely human, not the religious"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2055,"part of our education, and never could have grown out of a standard of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2056,"ethics in which the only worth, professedly recognised, is that of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2057,obedience.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2058,I am as far as any one from pretending that these defects are
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2059,"necessarily inherent in the Christian ethics, in every manner in which"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2060,"it can be conceived, or that the many requisites of a complete moral"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2061,"doctrine which it does not contain, do not admit of being reconciled"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2062,with it. Far less would I insinuate this of the doctrines and precepts
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2063,"of Christ himself. I believe that the sayings of Christ are all, that I"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2064,can see any evidence of their having been intended to be; that they are
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2065,irreconcilable with nothing which a comprehensive morality requires;
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2066,"that everything which is excellent in ethics may be brought within them,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2067,with no greater violence to their language than has been done to it by
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2068,all who have attempted to deduce from them any practical system of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2069,"conduct whatever. But it is quite consistent with this, to believe that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2070,"they contain, and were meant to contain, only a part of the truth; that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2071,many essential elements of the highest morality are among the things
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2072,"which are not provided for, nor intended to be provided for, in the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2073,"recorded deliverances of the Founder of Christianity, and which have"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2074,been entirely thrown aside in the system of ethics erected on the basis
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2075,"of those deliverances by the Christian Church. And this being so, I"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2076,think it a great error to persist in attempting to find in the Christian
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2077,"doctrine that complete rule for our guidance, which its author intended"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2078,"it to sanction and enforce, but only partially to provide. I believe,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2079,"too, that this narrow theory is becoming a grave practical evil,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2080,"detracting greatly from the value of the moral training and instruction,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2081,which so many well-meaning persons are now at length exerting themselves
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2082,to promote. I much fear that by attempting to form the mind and feelings
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2083,"on an exclusively religious type, and discarding those secular"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2084,standards (as for want of a better name they may be called) which
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2085,"heretofore co-existed with and supplemented the Christian ethics,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2086,"receiving some of its spirit, and infusing into it some of theirs, there"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2087,"will result, and is even now resulting, a low, abject, servile type of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2088,"character, which, submit itself as it may to what it deems the Supreme"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2089,"Will, is incapable of rising to or sympathising in the conception of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2090,Supreme Goodness. I believe that other ethics than any which can be
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2091,"evolved from exclusively Christian sources, must exist side by side with"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2092,Christian ethics to produce the moral regeneration of mankind; and that
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2093,"the Christian system is no exception to the rule, that in an imperfect"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2094,"state of the human mind, the interests of truth require a diversity of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2095,opinions. It is not necessary that in ceasing to ignore the moral truths
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2096,"not contained in Christianity, men should ignore any of those which it"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2097,"does contain. Such prejudice, or oversight, when it occurs, is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2098,altogether an evil; but it is one from which we cannot hope to be always
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2099,"exempt, and must be regarded as the price paid for an inestimable good."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2100,"The exclusive pretension made by a part of the truth to be the whole,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2101,"must and ought to be protested against, and if a reactionary impulse"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2102,"should make the protestors unjust in their turn, this one-sidedness,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2103,"like the other, may be lamented, but must be tolerated. If Christians"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2104,"would teach infidels to be just to Christianity, they should themselves"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2105,"be just to infidelity. It can do truth no service to blink the fact,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2106,known to all who have the most ordinary acquaintance with literary
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2107,"history, that a large portion of the noblest and most valuable moral"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2108,"teaching has been the work, not only of men who did not know, but of men"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2109,"who knew and rejected, the Christian faith."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2110,I do not pretend that the most unlimited use of the freedom of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2111,enunciating all possible opinions would put an end to the evils of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2112,religious or philosophical sectarianism. Every truth which men of narrow
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2113,"capacity are in earnest about, is sure to be asserted, inculcated, and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2114,"in many ways even acted on, as if no other truth existed in the world,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2115,or at all events none that could limit or qualify the first. I
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2116,acknowledge that the tendency of all opinions to become sectarian is not
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2117,"cured by the freest discussion, but is often heightened and exacerbated"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2118,"thereby; the truth which ought to have been, but was not, seen, being"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2119,rejected all the more violently because proclaimed by persons regarded
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2120,"as opponents. But it is not on the impassioned partisan, it is on the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2121,"calmer and more disinterested bystander, that this collision of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2122,opinions works its salutary effect. Not the violent conflict between
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2123,"parts of the truth, but the quiet suppression of half of it, is the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2124,formidable evil: there is always hope when people are forced to listen
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2125,to both sides; it is when they attend only to one that errors harden
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2126,"into prejudices, and truth itself ceases to have the effect of truth, by"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2127,being exaggerated into falsehood. And since there are few mental
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2128,attributes more rare than that judicial faculty which can sit in
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2129,"intelligent judgment between two sides of a question, of which only one"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2130,"is represented by an advocate before it, truth has no chance but in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2131,"proportion as every side of it, every opinion which embodies any"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2132,"fraction of the truth, not only finds advocates, but is so advocated as"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2133,to be listened to.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2134,We have now recognised the necessity to the mental well-being of mankind
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2135,"(on which all their other well-being depends) of freedom of opinion, and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2136,"freedom of the expression of opinion, on four distinct grounds; which we"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2137,will now briefly recapitulate.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2138,"First, if any opinion is compelled to silence, that opinion may, for"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2139,"aught we can certainly know, be true. To deny this is to assume our own"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2140,infallibility.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2141,"Secondly, though the silenced opinion be an error, it may, and very"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2142,"commonly does, contain a portion of truth; and since the general or"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2143,"prevailing opinion on any subject is rarely or never the whole truth, it"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2144,"is only by the collision of adverse opinions, that the remainder of the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2145,truth has any chance of being supplied.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2146,"Thirdly, even if the received opinion be not only true, but the whole"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2147,"truth; unless it is suffered to be, and actually is, vigorously and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2148,"earnestly contested, it will, by most of those who receive it, be held"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2149,"in the manner of a prejudice, with little comprehension or feeling of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2150,"its rational grounds. And not only this, but, fourthly, the meaning of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2151,"the doctrine itself will be in danger of being lost, or enfeebled, and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2152,deprived of its vital effect on the character and conduct: the dogma
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2153,"becoming a mere formal profession, inefficacious for good, but cumbering"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2154,"the ground, and preventing the growth of any real and heartfelt"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2155,"conviction, from reason or personal experience."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2156,"Before quitting the subject of freedom of opinion, it is fit to take"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2157,"some notice of those who say, that the free expression of all opinions"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2158,"should be permitted, on condition that the manner be temperate, and do"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2159,not pass the bounds of fair discussion. Much might be said on the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2160,impossibility of fixing where these supposed bounds are to be placed;
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2161,"for if the test be offence to those whose opinion is attacked, I think"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2162,experience testifies that this offence is given whenever the attack is
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2163,"telling and powerful, and that every opponent who pushes them hard, and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2164,"whom they find it difficult to answer, appears to them, if he shows any"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2165,"strong feeling on the subject, an intemperate opponent. But this, though"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2166,"an important consideration in a practical point of view, merges in a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2167,more fundamental objection. Undoubtedly the manner of asserting an
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2168,"opinion, even though it be a true one, may be very objectionable, and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2169,may justly incur severe censure. But the principal offences of the kind
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2170,"are such as it is mostly impossible, unless by accidental self-betrayal,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2171,"to bring home to conviction. The gravest of them is, to argue"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2172,"sophistically, to suppress facts or arguments, to misstate the elements"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2173,"of the case, or misrepresent the opposite opinion. But all this, even to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2174,"the most aggravated degree, is so continually done in perfect good"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2175,"faith, by persons who are not considered, and in many other respects may"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2176,"not deserve to be considered, ignorant or incompetent, that it is rarely"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2177,possible on adequate grounds conscientiously to stamp the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2178,misrepresentation as morally culpable; and still less could law presume
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2179,to interfere with this kind of controversial misconduct. With regard to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2180,"what is commonly meant by intemperate discussion, namely invective,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2181,"sarcasm, personality, and the like, the denunciation of these weapons"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2182,would deserve more sympathy if it were ever proposed to interdict them
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2183,equally to both sides; but it is only desired to restrain the employment
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2184,of them against the prevailing opinion: against the unprevailing they
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2185,"may not only be used without general disapproval, but will be likely to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2186,obtain for him who uses them the praise of honest zeal and righteous
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2187,"indignation. Yet whatever mischief arises from their use, is greatest"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2188,when they are employed against the comparatively defenceless; and
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2189,whatever unfair advantage can be derived by any opinion from this mode
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2190,"of asserting it, accrues almost exclusively to received opinions. The"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2191,"worst offence of this kind which can be committed by a polemic, is to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2192,stigmatise those who hold the contrary opinion as bad and immoral men.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2193,"To calumny of this sort, those who hold any unpopular opinion are"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2194,"peculiarly exposed, because they are in general few and uninfluential,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2195,and nobody but themselves feel much interest in seeing justice done
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2196,"them; but this weapon is, from the nature of the case, denied to those"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2197,who attack a prevailing opinion: they can neither use it with safety to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2198,"themselves, nor, if they could, would it do anything but recoil on their"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2199,"own cause. In general, opinions contrary to those commonly received can"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2200,"only obtain a hearing by studied moderation of language, and the most"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2201,"cautious avoidance of unnecessary offence, from which they hardly ever"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2202,deviate even in a slight degree without losing ground: while unmeasured
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2203,"vituperation employed on the side of the prevailing opinion, really does"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2204,"deter people from professing contrary opinions, and from listening to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2205,"those who profess them. For the interest, therefore, of truth and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2206,"justice, it is far more important to restrain this employment of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2207,"vituperative language than the other; and, for example, if it were"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2208,"necessary to choose, there would be much more need to discourage"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2209,"offensive attacks on infidelity, than on religion. It is, however,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2210,"obvious that law and authority have no business with restraining either,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2211,"while opinion ought, in every instance, to determine its verdict by the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2212,"circumstances of the individual case; condemning every one, on whichever"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2213,"side of the argument he places himself, in whose mode of advocacy either"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2214,"want of candour, or malignity, bigotry, or intolerance of feeling"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2215,manifest themselves; but not inferring these vices from the side which
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2216,"a person takes, though it be the contrary side of the question to our"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2217,"own: and giving merited honour to every one, whatever opinion he may"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2218,"hold, who has calmness to see and honesty to state what his opponents"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2219,"and their opinions really are, exaggerating nothing to their discredit,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2220,"keeping nothing back which tells, or can be supposed to tell, in their"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2221,favour. This is the real morality of public discussion; and if often
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2222,"violated, I am happy to think that there are many controversialists who"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2223,"to a great extent observe it, and a still greater number who"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2224,conscientiously strive towards it.

John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2229,"has not, however, induced me to alter a single word in the text, nor has"

John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2234,political prosecutions. The offence charged was not that of criticising
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2235,"institutions, or the acts or persons of rulers, but of circulating what"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2236,"was deemed an immoral doctrine, the lawfulness of Tyrannicide."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2237,"If the arguments of the present chapter are of any validity, there ought"

John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2239,"of ethical conviction, any doctrine, however immoral it may be"

John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2242,"shall content myself with saying, that the subject has been at all times"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2243,one of the open questions of morals; that the act of a private citizen
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2244,"in striking down a criminal, who, by raising himself above the law, has"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2245,"placed himself beyond the reach of legal punishment or control, has been"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2246,"accounted by whole nations, and by some of the best and wisest of men,"

John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2248,"is not of the nature of assassination, but of civil war. As such, I hold"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2249,"that the instigation to it, in a specific case, may be a proper subject"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2250,"of punishment, but only if an overt act has followed, and at least a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2251,probable connection can be established between the act and the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2252,"instigation. Even then, it is not a foreign government, but the very"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2253,"government assailed, which alone, in the exercise of self-defence, can"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2254,legitimately punish attacks directed against its own existence.

John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2259,[10] Ample warning may be drawn from the large infusion of the passions
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2260,"of a persecutor, which mingled with the general display of the worst"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2261,parts of our national character on the occasion of the Sepoy
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2262,insurrection. The ravings of fanatics or charlatans from the pulpit may
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2263,be unworthy of notice; but the heads of the Evangelical party have
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2264,"announced as their principle, for the government of Hindoos and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2265,"Mahomedans, that no schools be supported by public money in which the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2266,"Bible is not taught, and by necessary consequence that no public"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2267,employment be given to any but real or pretended Christians. An
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2268,"Under-Secretary of State, in a speech delivered to his constituents on"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2269,"the 12th of November, 1857, is reported to have said: ""Toleration of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2270,"their faith"" (the faith of a hundred millions of British subjects), ""the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2271,"superstition which they called religion, by the British Government, had"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2272,"had the effect of retarding the ascendency of the British name, and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2273,preventing the salutary growth of Christianity.... Toleration was the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2274,great corner-stone of the religious liberties of this country; but do
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2275,"not let them abuse that precious word toleration. As he understood it,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2276,"it meant the complete liberty to all, freedom of worship, _among"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2277,"Christians, who worshipped upon the same foundation_. It meant"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2278,toleration of all sects and denominations of _Christians who believed in
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2279,"the one mediation_."" I desire to call attention to the fact, that a man"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2280,who has been deemed fit to fill a high office in the government of this
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2281,"country, under a liberal Ministry, maintains the doctrine that all who"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2282,do not believe in the divinity of Christ are beyond the pale of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2283,"toleration. Who, after this imbecile display, can indulge the illusion"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,2,2284,"that religious persecution has passed away, never to return?"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2285,CHAPTER III.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2286,"OF INDIVIDUALITY, AS ONE OF THE ELEMENTS OF WELL-BEING."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2287,Such being the reasons which make it imperative that human beings should
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2288,"be free to form opinions, and to express their opinions without reserve;"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2289,"and such the baneful consequences to the intellectual, and through that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2290,"to the moral nature of man, unless this liberty is either conceded, or"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2291,asserted in spite of prohibition; let us next examine whether the same
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2292,reasons do not require that men should be free to act upon their
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2293,"opinions--to carry these out in their lives, without hindrance, either"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2294,"physical or moral, from their fellow-men, so long as it is at their own"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2295,risk and peril. This last proviso is of course indispensable. No one
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2296,"pretends that actions should be as free as opinions. On the contrary,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2297,"even opinions lose their immunity, when the circumstances in which they"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2298,are expressed are such as to constitute their expression a positive
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2299,instigation to some mischievous act. An opinion that corn-dealers are
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2300,"starvers of the poor, or that private property is robbery, ought to be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2301,"unmolested when simply circulated through the press, but may justly"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2302,incur punishment when delivered orally to an excited mob assembled
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2303,"before the house of a corn-dealer, or when handed about among the same"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2304,"mob in the form of a placard. Acts, of whatever kind, which, without"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2305,"justifiable cause, do harm to others, may be, and in the more important"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2306,"cases absolutely require to be, controlled by the unfavourable"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2307,"sentiments, and, when needful, by the active interference of mankind."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2308,The liberty of the individual must be thus far limited; he must not make
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2309,himself a nuisance to other people. But if he refrains from molesting
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2310,"others in what concerns them, and merely acts according to his own"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2311,"inclination and judgment in things which concern himself, the same"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2312,"reasons which show that opinion should be free, prove also that he"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2313,"should be allowed, without molestation, to carry his opinions into"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2314,practice at his own cost. That mankind are not infallible; that their
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2315,"truths, for the most part, are only half-truths; that unity of opinion,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2316,unless resulting from the fullest and freest comparison of opposite
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2317,"opinions, is not desirable, and diversity not an evil, but a good,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2318,until mankind are much more capable than at present of recognising all
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2319,"sides of the truth, are principles applicable to men's modes of action,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2320,not less than to their opinions. As it is useful that while mankind are
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2321,"imperfect there should be different opinions, so is it that there should"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2322,be different experiments of living; that free scope should be given to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2323,"varieties of character, short of injury to others; and that the worth of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2324,"different modes of life should be proved practically, when any one"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2325,"thinks fit to try them. It is desirable, in short, that in things which"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2326,"do not primarily concern others, individuality should assert itself."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2327,"Where, not the person's own character, but the traditions or customs of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2328,"other people are the rule of conduct, there is wanting one of the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2329,"principal ingredients of human happiness, and quite the chief ingredient"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2330,of individual and social progress.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2331,"In maintaining this principle, the greatest difficulty to be encountered"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2332,"does not lie in the appreciation of means towards an acknowledged end,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2333,but in the indifference of persons in general to the end itself. If it
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2334,were felt that the free development of individuality is one of the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2335,leading essentials of well-being; that it is not only a co-ordinate
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2336,"element with all that is designated by the terms civilisation,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2337,"instruction, education, culture, but is itself a necessary part and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2338,condition of all those things; there would be no danger that liberty
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2339,"should be under-valued, and the adjustment of the boundaries between it"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2340,and social control would present no extraordinary difficulty. But the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2341,"evil is, that individual spontaneity is hardly recognised by the common"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2342,"modes of thinking, as having any intrinsic worth, or deserving any"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2343,"regard on its own account. The majority, being satisfied with the ways"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2344,"of mankind as they now are (for it is they who make them what they are),"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2345,cannot comprehend why those ways should not be good enough for
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2346,"everybody; and what is more, spontaneity forms no part of the ideal of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2347,"the majority of moral and social reformers, but is rather looked on with"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2348,"jealousy, as a troublesome and perhaps rebellious obstruction to the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2349,"general acceptance of what these reformers, in their own judgment, think"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2350,"would be best for mankind. Few persons, out of Germany, even comprehend"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2351,"the meaning of the doctrine which Wilhelm von Humboldt, so eminent both"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2352,"as a _savant_ and as a politician, made the text of a treatise--that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2353,"""the end of man, or that which is prescribed by the eternal or immutable"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2354,"dictates of reason, and not suggested by vague and transient desires,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2355,is the highest and most harmonious development of his powers to a
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2356,"complete and consistent whole;"" that, therefore, the object ""towards"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2357,"which every human being must ceaselessly direct his efforts, and on"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2358,which especially those who design to influence their fellow-men must
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2359,"ever keep their eyes, is the individuality of power and development;"""
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2360,"that for this there are two requisites, ""freedom, and a variety of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2361,"situations;"" and that from the union of these arise ""individual vigour"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2362,"and manifold diversity,"" which combine themselves in ""originality.""[11]"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2363,"Little, however, as people are accustomed to a doctrine like that of Von"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2364,"Humboldt, and surprising as it may be to them to find so high a value"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2365,"attached to individuality, the question, one must nevertheless think,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2366,can only be one of degree. No one's idea of excellence in conduct is
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2367,that people should do absolutely nothing but copy one another. No one
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2368,"would assert that people ought not to put into their mode of life, and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2369,"into the conduct of their concerns, any impress whatever of their own"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2370,"judgment, or of their own individual character. On the other hand, it"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2371,would be absurd to pretend that people ought to live as if nothing
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2372,whatever had been known in the world before they came into it; as if
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2373,experience had as yet done nothing towards showing that one mode of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2374,"existence, or of conduct, is preferable to another. Nobody denies that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2375,"people should be so taught and trained in youth, as to know and benefit"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2376,by the ascertained results of human experience. But it is the privilege
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2377,"and proper condition of a human being, arrived at the maturity of his"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2378,"faculties, to use and interpret experience in his own way. It is for him"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2379,to find out what part of recorded experience is properly applicable to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2380,his own circumstances and character. The traditions and customs of other
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2381,"people are, to a certain extent, evidence of what their experience has"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2382,"taught _them_; presumptive evidence, and as such, have a claim to his"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2383,"deference: but, in the first place, their experience may be too narrow;"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2384,"or they may not have interpreted it rightly. Secondly, their"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2385,"interpretation of experience may be correct, but unsuitable to him."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2386,"Customs are made for customary circumstances, and customary characters:"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2387,"and his circumstances or his character may be uncustomary. Thirdly,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2388,"though the customs be both good as customs, and suitable to him, yet to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2389,"conform to custom, merely _as_ custom, does not educate or develop in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2390,him any of the qualities which are the distinctive endowment of a human
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2391,"being. The human faculties of perception, judgment, discriminative"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2392,"feeling, mental activity, and even moral preference, are exercised only"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2393,"in making a choice. He who does anything because it is the custom, makes"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2394,no choice. He gains no practice either in discerning or in desiring what
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2395,"is best. The mental and moral, like the muscular powers, are improved"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2396,only by being used. The faculties are called into no exercise by doing a
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2397,"thing merely because others do it, no more than by believing a thing"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2398,only because others believe it. If the grounds of an opinion are not
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2399,"conclusive to the person's own reason, his reason cannot be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2400,"strengthened, but is likely to be weakened by his adopting it: and if"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2401,the inducements to an act are not such as are consentaneous to his own
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2402,"feelings and character (where affection, or the rights of others, are"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2403,"not concerned), it is so much done towards rendering his feelings and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2404,"character inert and torpid, instead of active and energetic."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2405,"He who lets the world, or his own portion of it, choose his plan of life"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2406,"for him, has no need of any other faculty than the ape-like one of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2407,"imitation. He who chooses his plan for himself, employs all his"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2408,"faculties. He must use observation to see, reasoning and judgment to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2409,"foresee, activity to gather materials for decision, discrimination to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2410,"decide, and when he has decided, firmness and self-control to hold to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2411,his deliberate decision. And these qualities he requires and exercises
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2412,exactly in proportion as the part of his conduct which he determines
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2413,according to his own judgment and feelings is a large one. It is
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2414,"possible that he might be guided in some good path, and kept out of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2415,"harm's way, without any of these things. But what will be his"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2416,"comparative worth as a human being? It really is of importance, not only"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2417,"what men do, but also what manner of men they are that do it. Among the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2418,"works of man, which human life is rightly employed in perfecting and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2419,"beautifying, the first in importance surely is man himself. Supposing it"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2420,"were possible to get houses built, corn grown, battles fought, causes"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2421,"tried, and even churches erected and prayers said, by machinery--by"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2422,automatons in human form--it would be a considerable loss to exchange
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2423,for these automatons even the men and women who at present inhabit the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2424,"more civilised parts of the world, and who assuredly are but starved"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2425,specimens of what nature can and will produce. Human nature is not a
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2426,"machine to be built after a model, and set to do exactly the work"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2427,"prescribed for it, but a tree, which requires to grow and develop"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2428,"itself on all sides, according to the tendency of the inward forces"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2429,which make it a living thing.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2430,It will probably be conceded that it is desirable people should exercise
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2431,"their understandings, and that an intelligent following of custom, or"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2432,"even occasionally an intelligent deviation from custom, is better than a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2433,blind and simply mechanical adhesion to it. To a certain extent it is
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2434,"admitted, that our understanding should be our own: but there is not the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2435,same willingness to admit that our desires and impulses should be our
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2436,"own likewise; or that to possess impulses of our own, and of any"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2437,"strength, is anything but a peril and a snare. Yet desires and impulses"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2438,"are as much a part of a perfect human being, as beliefs and restraints:"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2439,and strong impulses are only perilous when not properly balanced; when
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2440,"one set of aims and inclinations is developed into strength, while"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2441,"others, which ought to co-exist with them, remain weak and inactive. It"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2442,is not because men's desires are strong that they act ill; it is because
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2443,their consciences are weak. There is no natural connection between
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2444,strong impulses and a weak conscience. The natural connection is the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2445,other way. To say that one person's desires and feelings are stronger
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2446,"and more various than those of another, is merely to say that he has"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2447,"more of the raw material of human nature, and is therefore capable,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2448,"perhaps of more evil, but certainly of more good. Strong impulses are"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2449,but another name for energy. Energy may be turned to bad uses; but more
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2450,"good may always be made of an energetic nature, than of an indolent and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2451,"impassive one. Those who have most natural feeling, are always those"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2452,whose cultivated feelings may be made the strongest. The same strong
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2453,"susceptibilities which make the personal impulses vivid and powerful,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2454,are also the source from whence are generated the most passionate love
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2455,"of virtue, and the sternest self-control. It is through the cultivation"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2456,"of these, that society both does its duty and protects its interests:"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2457,"not by rejecting the stuff of which heroes are made, because it knows"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2458,not how to make them. A person whose desires and impulses are his
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2459,"own--are the expression of his own nature, as it has been developed and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2460,modified by his own culture--is said to have a character. One whose
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2461,"desires and impulses are not his own, has no character, no more than a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2462,"steam-engine has a character. If, in addition to being his own, his"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2463,"impulses are strong, and are under the government of a strong will, he"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2464,has an energetic character. Whoever thinks that individuality of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2465,"desires and impulses should not be encouraged to unfold itself, must"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2466,maintain that society has no need of strong natures--is not the better
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2467,for containing many persons who have much character--and that a high
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2468,general average of energy is not desirable.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2469,"In some early states of society, these forces might be, and were, too"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2470,much ahead of the power which society then possessed of disciplining and
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2471,controlling them. There has been a time when the element of spontaneity
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2472,"and individuality was in excess, and the social principle had a hard"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2473,"struggle with it. The difficulty then was, to induce men of strong"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2474,bodies or minds to pay obedience to any rules which required them to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2475,"control their impulses. To overcome this difficulty, law and discipline,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2476,"like the Popes struggling against the Emperors, asserted a power over"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2477,"the whole man, claiming to control all his life in order to control his"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2478,character--which society had not found any other sufficient means of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2479,binding. But society has now fairly got the better of individuality; and
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2480,"the danger which threatens human nature is not the excess, but the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2481,"deficiency, of personal impulses and preferences. Things are vastly"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2482,"changed, since the passions of those who were strong by station or by"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2483,personal endowment were in a state of habitual rebellion against laws
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2484,"and ordinances, and required to be rigorously chained up to enable the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2485,persons within their reach to enjoy any particle of security. In our
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2486,"times, from the highest class of society down to the lowest, every one"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2487,lives as under the eye of a hostile and dreaded censorship. Not only in
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2488,"what concerns others, but in what concerns only themselves, the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2489,"individual, or the family, do not ask themselves--what do I prefer? or,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2490,"what would suit my character and disposition? or, what would allow the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2491,"best and highest in me to have fair-play, and enable it to grow and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2492,"thrive? They ask themselves, what is suitable to my position? what is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2493,usually done by persons of my station and pecuniary circumstances? or
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2494,(worse still) what is usually done by persons of a station and
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2495,circumstances superior to mine? I do not mean that they choose what is
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2496,"customary, in preference to what suits their own inclination. It does"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2497,"not occur to them to have any inclination, except for what is customary."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2498,Thus the mind itself is bowed to the yoke: even in what people do for
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2499,"pleasure, conformity is the first thing thought of; they like in crowds;"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2500,they exercise choice only among things commonly done: peculiarity of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2501,"taste, eccentricity of conduct, are shunned equally with crimes: until"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2502,"by dint of not following their own nature, they have no nature to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2503,follow: their human capacities are withered and starved: they become
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2504,"incapable of any strong wishes or native pleasures, and are generally"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2505,"without either opinions or feelings of home growth, or properly their"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2506,"own. Now is this, or is it not, the desirable condition of human nature?"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2507,"It is so, on the Calvinistic theory. According to that, the one great"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2508,"offence of man is Self-will. All the good of which humanity is capable,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2509,"is comprised in Obedience. You have no choice; thus you must do, and no"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2510,"otherwise: ""whatever is not a duty, is a sin."" Human nature being"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2511,"radically corrupt, there is no redemption for any one until human nature"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2512,"is killed within him. To one holding this theory of life, crushing out"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2513,"any of the human faculties, capacities, and susceptibilities, is no"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2514,"evil: man needs no capacity, but that of surrendering himself to the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2515,will of God: and if he uses any of his faculties for any other purpose
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2516,"but to do that supposed will more effectually, he is better without"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2517,"them. That is the theory of Calvinism; and it is held, in a mitigated"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2518,"form, by many who do not consider themselves Calvinists; the mitigation"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2519,consisting in giving a less ascetic interpretation to the alleged will
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2520,of God; asserting it to be his will that mankind should gratify some of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2521,"their inclinations; of course not in the manner they themselves prefer,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2522,"but in the way of obedience, that is, in a way prescribed to them by"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2523,"authority; and, therefore, by the necessary conditions of the case, the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2524,same for all.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2525,In some such insidious form there is at present a strong tendency to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2526,"this narrow theory of life, and to the pinched and hidebound type of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2527,"human character which it patronises. Many persons, no doubt, sincerely"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2528,"think that human beings thus cramped and dwarfed, are as their Maker"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2529,designed them to be; just as many have thought that trees are a much
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2530,"finer thing when clipped into pollards, or cut out into figures of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2531,"animals, than as nature made them. But if it be any part of religion to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2532,"believe that man was made by a good being, it is more consistent with"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2533,"that faith to believe, that this Being gave all human faculties that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2534,"they might be cultivated and unfolded, not rooted out and consumed, and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2535,that he takes delight in every nearer approach made by his creatures to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2536,"the ideal conception embodied in them, every increase in any of their"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2537,"capabilities of comprehension, of action, or of enjoyment. There is a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2538,different type of human excellence from the Calvinistic; a conception of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2539,humanity as having its nature bestowed on it for other purposes than
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2540,"merely to be abnegated. ""Pagan self-assertion"" is one of the elements of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2541,"human worth, as well as ""Christian self-denial.""[12] There is a Greek"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2542,"ideal of self-development, which the Platonic and Christian ideal of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2543,"self-government blends with, but does not supersede. It may be better to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2544,"be a John Knox than an Alcibiades, but it is better to be a Pericles"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2545,"than either; nor would a Pericles, if we had one in these days, be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2546,without anything good which belonged to John Knox.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2547,It is not by wearing down into uniformity all that is individual in
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2548,"themselves, but by cultivating it and calling it forth, within the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2549,"limits imposed by the rights and interests of others, that human beings"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2550,become a noble and beautiful object of contemplation; and as the works
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2551,"partake the character of those who do them, by the same process human"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2552,"life also becomes rich, diversified, and animating, furnishing more"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2553,"abundant aliment to high thoughts and elevating feelings, and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2554,"strengthening the tie which binds every individual to the race, by"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2555,making the race infinitely better worth belonging to. In proportion to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2556,"the development of his individuality, each person becomes more valuable"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2557,"to himself, and is therefore capable of being more valuable to others."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2558,"There is a greater fulness of life about his own existence, and when"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2559,there is more life in the units there is more in the mass which is
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2560,composed of them. As much compression as is necessary to prevent the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2561,stronger specimens of human nature from encroaching on the rights of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2562,"others, cannot be dispensed with; but for this there is ample"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2563,compensation even in the point of view of human development. The means
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2564,of development which the individual loses by being prevented from
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2565,"gratifying his inclinations to the injury of others, are chiefly"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2566,obtained at the expense of the development of other people. And even to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2567,himself there is a full equivalent in the better development of the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2568,"social part of his nature, rendered possible by the restraint put upon"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2569,the selfish part. To be held to rigid rules of justice for the sake of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2570,"others, develops the feelings and capacities which have the good of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2571,others for their object. But to be restrained in things not affecting
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2572,"their good, by their mere displeasure, develops nothing valuable, except"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2573,such force of character as may unfold itself in resisting the restraint.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2574,"If acquiesced in, it dulls and blunts the whole nature. To give any"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2575,"fair-play to the nature of each, it is essential that different persons"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2576,should be allowed to lead different lives. In proportion as this
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2577,"latitude has been exercised in any age, has that age been noteworthy to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2578,"posterity. Even despotism does not produce its worst effects, so long as"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2579,Individuality exists under it; and whatever crushes individuality is
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2580,"despotism, by whatever name it may be called, and whether it professes"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2581,to be enforcing the will of God or the injunctions of men.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2582,"Having said that Individuality is the same thing with development, and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2583,"that it is only the cultivation of individuality which produces, or can"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2584,"produce, well-developed human beings, I might here close the argument:"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2585,"for what more or better can be said of any condition of human affairs,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2586,than that it brings human beings themselves nearer to the best thing
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2587,"they can be? or what worse can be said of any obstruction to good, than"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2588,"that it prevents this? Doubtless, however, these considerations will not"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2589,suffice to convince those who most need convincing; and it is necessary
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2590,"further to show, that these developed human beings are of some use to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2591,"the undeveloped--to point out to those who do not desire liberty, and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2592,"would not avail themselves of it, that they may be in some intelligible"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2593,manner rewarded for allowing other people to make use of it without
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2594,hindrance.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2595,"In the first place, then, I would suggest that they might possibly"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2596,"learn something from them. It will not be denied by anybody, that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2597,originality is a valuable element in human affairs. There is always need
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2598,"of persons not only to discover new truths, and point out when what were"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2599,"once truths are true no longer, but also to commence new practices, and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2600,"set the example of more enlightened conduct, and better taste and sense"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2601,in human life. This cannot well be gainsaid by anybody who does not
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2602,believe that the world has already attained perfection in all its ways
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2603,and practices. It is true that this benefit is not capable of being
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2604,"rendered by everybody alike: there are but few persons, in comparison"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2605,"with the whole of mankind, whose experiments, if adopted by others,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2606,would be likely to be any improvement on established practice. But these
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2607,"few are the salt of the earth; without them, human life would become a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2608,stagnant pool. Not only is it they who introduce good things which did
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2609,not before exist; it is they who keep the life in those which already
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2610,"existed. If there were nothing new to be done, would human intellect"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2611,cease to be necessary? Would it be a reason why those who do the old
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2612,"things should forget why they are done, and do them like cattle, not"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2613,like human beings? There is only too great a tendency in the best
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2614,beliefs and practices to degenerate into the mechanical; and unless
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2615,there were a succession of persons whose ever-recurring originality
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2616,prevents the grounds of those beliefs and practices from becoming merely
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2617,"traditional, such dead matter would not resist the smallest shock from"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2618,"anything really alive, and there would be no reason why civilisation"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2619,"should not die out, as in the Byzantine Empire. Persons of genius, it is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2620,"true, are, and are always likely to be, a small minority; but in order"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2621,"to have them, it is necessary to preserve the soil in which they grow."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2622,Genius can only breathe freely in an _atmosphere_ of freedom. Persons of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2623,"genius are, _ex vi termini_, _more_ individual than any other"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2624,"people--less capable, consequently, of fitting themselves, without"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2625,"hurtful compression, into any of the small number of moulds which"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2626,society provides in order to save its members the trouble of forming
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2627,their own character. If from timidity they consent to be forced into one
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2628,"of these moulds, and to let all that part of themselves which cannot"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2629,"expand under the pressure remain unexpanded, society will be little the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2630,"better for their genius. If they are of a strong character, and break"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2631,"their fetters, they become a mark for the society which has not"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2632,"succeeded in reducing them to commonplace, to point at with solemn"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2633,"warning as ""wild,"" ""erratic,"" and the like; much as if one should"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2634,complain of the Niagara river for not flowing smoothly between its banks
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2635,like a Dutch canal.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2636,"I insist thus emphatically on the importance of genius, and the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2637,necessity of allowing it to unfold itself freely both in thought and in
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2638,"practice, being well aware that no one will deny the position in theory,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2639,"but knowing also that almost every one, in reality, is totally"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2640,indifferent to it. People think genius a fine thing if it enables a man
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2641,"to write an exciting poem, or paint a picture. But in its true sense,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2642,"that of originality in thought and action, though no one says that it is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2643,"not a thing to be admired, nearly all, at heart, think that they can do"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2644,very well without it. Unhappily this is too natural to be wondered at.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2645,Originality is the one thing which unoriginal minds cannot feel the use
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2646,of. They cannot see what it is to do for them: how should they? If they
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2647,"could see what it would do for them, it would not be originality. The"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2648,"first service which originality has to render them, is that of opening"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2649,"their eyes: which being once fully done, they would have a chance of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2650,"being themselves original. Meanwhile, recollecting that nothing was ever"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2651,"yet done which some one was not the first to do, and that all good"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2652,"things which exist are the fruits of originality, let them be modest"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2653,enough to believe that there is something still left for it to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2654,"accomplish, and assure themselves that they are more in need of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2655,"originality, the less they are conscious of the want."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2656,"In sober truth, whatever homage may be professed, or even paid, to real"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2657,"or supposed mental superiority, the general tendency of things"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2658,throughout the world is to render mediocrity the ascendant power among
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2659,"mankind. In ancient history, in the middle ages, and in a diminishing"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2660,"degree through the long transition from feudality to the present time,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2661,the individual was a power in himself; and if he had either great
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2662,"talents or a high social position, he was a considerable power. At"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2663,present individuals are lost in the crowd. In politics it is almost a
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2664,triviality to say that public opinion now rules the world. The only
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2665,"power deserving the name is that of masses, and of governments while"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2666,they make themselves the organ of the tendencies and instincts of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2667,masses. This is as true in the moral and social relations of private
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2668,life as in public transactions. Those whose opinions go by the name of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2669,"public opinion, are not always the same sort of public: in America they"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2670,"are the whole white population; in England, chiefly the middle class."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2671,"But they are always a mass, that is to say, collective mediocrity. And"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2672,"what is a still greater novelty, the mass do not now take their opinions"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2673,"from dignitaries in Church or State, from ostensible leaders, or from"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2674,"books. Their thinking is done for them by men much like themselves,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2675,"addressing them or speaking in their name, on the spur of the moment,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2676,through the newspapers. I am not complaining of all this. I do not
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2677,"assert that anything better is compatible, as a general rule, with the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2678,present low state of the human mind. But that does not hinder the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2679,government of mediocrity from being mediocre government. No government
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2680,"by a democracy or a numerous aristocracy, either in its political acts"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2681,"or in the opinions, qualities, and tone of mind which it fosters, ever"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2682,"did or could rise above mediocrity, except in so far as the sovereign"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2683,Many have let themselves be guided (which in their best times they
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2684,always have done) by the counsels and influence of a more highly gifted
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2685,"and instructed One or Few. The initiation of all wise or noble things,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2686,comes and must come from individuals; generally at first from some one
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2687,individual. The honour and glory of the average man is that he is
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2688,capable of following that initiative; that he can respond internally to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2689,"wise and noble things, and be led to them with his eyes open. I am not"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2690,"countenancing the sort of ""hero-worship"" which applauds the strong man"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2691,of genius for forcibly seizing on the government of the world and making
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2692,"it do his bidding in spite of itself. All he can claim is, freedom to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2693,"point out the way. The power of compelling others into it, is not only"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2694,"inconsistent with the freedom and development of all the rest, but"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2695,"corrupting to the strong man himself. It does seem, however, that when"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2696,the opinions of masses of merely average men are everywhere become or
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2697,"becoming the dominant power, the counterpoise and corrective to that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2698,"tendency would be, the more and more pronounced individuality of those"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2699,who stand on the higher eminences of thought. It is in these
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2700,"circumstances most especially, that exceptional individuals, instead of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2701,"being deterred, should be encouraged in acting differently from the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2702,"mass. In other times there was no advantage in their doing so, unless"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2703,"they acted not only differently, but better. In this age the mere"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2704,"example of nonconformity, the mere refusal to bend the knee to custom,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2705,is itself a service. Precisely because the tyranny of opinion is such as
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2706,"to make eccentricity a reproach, it is desirable, in order to break"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2707,"through that tyranny, that people should be eccentric. Eccentricity has"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2708,always abounded when and where strength of character has abounded; and
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2709,the amount of eccentricity in a society has generally been proportional
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2710,"to the amount of genius, mental vigour, and moral courage which it"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2711,"contained. That so few now dare to be eccentric, marks the chief danger"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2712,of the time.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2713,I have said that it is important to give the freest scope possible to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2714,"uncustomary things, in order that it may in time appear which of these"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2715,"are fit to be converted into customs. But independence of action, and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2716,disregard of custom are not solely deserving of encouragement for the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2717,"chance they afford that better modes of action, and customs more worthy"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2718,"of general adoption, may be struck out; nor is it only persons of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2719,decided mental superiority who have a just claim to carry on their lives
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2720,in their own way. There is no reason that all human existences should be
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2721,"constructed on some one, or some small number of patterns. If a person"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2722,"possesses any tolerable amount of common-sense and experience, his own"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2723,"mode of laying out his existence is the best, not because it is the best"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2724,"in itself, but because it is his own mode. Human beings are not like"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2725,sheep; and even sheep are not undistinguishably alike. A man cannot get
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2726,"a coat or a pair of boots to fit him, unless they are either made to his"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2727,"measure, or he has a whole warehouseful to choose from: and is it easier"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2728,"to fit him with a life than with a coat, or are human beings more like"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2729,one another in their whole physical and spiritual conformation than in
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2730,the shape of their feet? If it were only that people have diversities of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2731,"taste, that is reason enough for not attempting to shape them all after"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2732,one model. But different persons also require different conditions for
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2733,their spiritual development; and can no more exist healthily in the same
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2734,"moral, than all the variety of plants can in the same physical,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2735,atmosphere and climate. The same things which are helps to one person
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2736,"towards the cultivation of his higher nature, are hindrances to another."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2737,"The same mode of life is a healthy excitement to one, keeping all his"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2738,"faculties of action and enjoyment in their best order, while to another"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2739,"it is a distracting burthen, which suspends or crushes all internal"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2740,life. Such are the differences among human beings in their sources of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2741,"pleasure, their susceptibilities of pain, and the operation on them of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2742,"different physical and moral agencies, that unless there is a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2743,"corresponding diversity in their modes of life, they neither obtain"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2744,"their fair share of happiness, nor grow up to the mental, moral, and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2745,aesthetic stature of which their nature is capable. Why then should
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2746,"tolerance, as far as the public sentiment is concerned, extend only to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2747,tastes and modes of life which extort acquiescence by the multitude of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2748,their adherents? Nowhere (except in some monastic institutions) is
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2749,"diversity of taste entirely unrecognised; a person may, without blame,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2750,"either like or dislike rowing, or smoking, or music, or athletic"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2751,"exercises, or chess, or cards, or study, because both those who like"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2752,"each of these things, and those who dislike them, are too numerous to be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2753,"put down. But the man, and still more the woman, who can be accused"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2754,"either of doing ""what nobody does,"" or of not doing ""what everybody"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2755,"does,"" is the subject of as much depreciatory remark as if he or she had"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2756,committed some grave moral delinquency. Persons require to possess a
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2757,"title, or some other badge of rank, or of the consideration of people of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2758,"rank, to be able to indulge somewhat in the luxury of doing as they like"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2759,"without detriment to their estimation. To indulge somewhat, I repeat:"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2760,"for whoever allow themselves much of that indulgence, incur the risk of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2761,something worse than disparaging speeches--they are in peril of a
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2762,"commission _de lunatico_, and of having their property taken from them"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2763,and given to their relations.[13]
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2764,"There is one characteristic of the present direction of public opinion,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2765,peculiarly calculated to make it intolerant of any marked demonstration
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2766,of individuality. The general average of mankind are not only moderate
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2767,"in intellect, but also moderate in inclinations: they have no tastes or"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2768,"wishes strong enough to incline them to do anything unusual, and they"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2769,"consequently do not understand those who have, and class all such with"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2770,the wild and intemperate whom they are accustomed to look down upon.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2771,"Now, in addition to this fact which is general, we have only to suppose"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2772,"that a strong movement has set in towards the improvement of morals,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2773,and it is evident what we have to expect. In these days such a movement
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2774,has set in; much has actually been effected in the way of increased
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2775,"regularity of conduct, and discouragement of excesses; and there is a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2776,"philanthropic spirit abroad, for the exercise of which there is no more"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2777,inviting field than the moral and prudential improvement of our
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2778,fellow-creatures. These tendencies of the times cause the public to be
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2779,more disposed than at most former periods to prescribe general rules of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2780,"conduct, and endeavour to make every one conform to the approved"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2781,"standard. And that standard, express or tacit, is to desire nothing"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2782,strongly. Its ideal of character is to be without any marked character;
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2783,"to maim by compression, like a Chinese lady's foot, every part of human"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2784,"nature which stands out prominently, and tends to make the person"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2785,markedly dissimilar in outline to commonplace humanity.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2786,As is usually the case with ideals which exclude one-half of what is
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2787,"desirable, the present standard of approbation produces only an inferior"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2788,imitation of the other half. Instead of great energies guided by
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2789,"vigorous reason, and strong feelings strongly controlled by a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2790,"conscientious will, its result is weak feelings and weak energies, which"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2791,therefore can be kept in outward conformity to rule without any strength
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2792,either of will or of reason. Already energetic characters on any large
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2793,scale are becoming merely traditional. There is now scarcely any outlet
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2794,for energy in this country except business. The energy expended in that
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2795,may still be regarded as considerable. What little is left from that
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2796,"employment, is expended on some hobby; which may be a useful, even a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2797,"philanthropic hobby, but is always some one thing, and generally a thing"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2798,of small dimensions. The greatness of England is now all collective:
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2799,"individually small, we only appear capable of anything great by our"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2800,habit of combining; and with this our moral and religious
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2801,philanthropists are perfectly contented. But it was men of another
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2802,stamp than this that made England what it has been; and men of another
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2803,stamp will be needed to prevent its decline.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2804,The despotism of custom is everywhere the standing hindrance to human
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2805,"advancement, being in unceasing antagonism to that disposition to aim at"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2806,"something better than customary, which is called, according to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2807,"circumstances, the spirit of liberty, or that of progress or"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2808,improvement. The spirit of improvement is not always a spirit of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2809,"liberty, for it may aim at forcing improvements on an unwilling people;"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2810,"and the spirit of liberty, in so far as it resists such attempts, may"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2811,ally itself locally and temporarily with the opponents of improvement;
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2812,"but the only unfailing and permanent source of improvement is liberty,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2813,since by it there are as many possible independent centres of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2814,"improvement as there are individuals. The progressive principle,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2815,"however, in either shape, whether as the love of liberty or of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2816,"improvement, is antagonistic to the sway of Custom, involving at least"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2817,emancipation from that yoke; and the contest between the two constitutes
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2818,the chief interest of the history of mankind. The greater part of the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2819,"world has, properly speaking, no history, because the despotism of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2820,Custom is complete. This is the case over the whole East. Custom is
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2821,"there, in all things, the final appeal; justice and right mean"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2822,"conformity to custom; the argument of custom no one, unless some tyrant"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2823,"intoxicated with power, thinks of resisting. And we see the result."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2824,Those nations must once have had originality; they did not start out of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2825,"the ground populous, lettered, and versed in many of the arts of life;"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2826,"they made themselves all this, and were then the greatest and most"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2827,powerful nations in the world. What are they now? The subjects or
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2828,dependants of tribes whose forefathers wandered in the forests when
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2829,"theirs had magnificent palaces and gorgeous temples, but over whom"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2830,custom exercised only a divided rule with liberty and progress. A
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2831,"people, it appears, may be progressive for a certain length of time, and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2832,then stop: when does it stop? When it ceases to possess individuality.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2833,"If a similar change should befall the nations of Europe, it will not be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2834,in exactly the same shape: the despotism of custom with which these
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2835,nations are threatened is not precisely stationariness. It proscribes
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2836,"singularity, but it does not preclude change, provided all change"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2837,together. We have discarded the fixed costumes of our forefathers; every
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2838,"one must still dress like other people, but the fashion may change once"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2839,"or twice a year. We thus take care that when there is change, it shall"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2840,"be for change's sake, and not from any idea of beauty or convenience;"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2841,for the same idea of beauty or convenience would not strike all the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2842,"world at the same moment, and be simultaneously thrown aside by all at"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2843,another moment. But we are progressive as well as changeable: we
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2844,"continually make new inventions in mechanical things, and keep them"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2845,until they are again superseded by better; we are eager for improvement
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2846,"in politics, in education, even in morals, though in this last our idea"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2847,of improvement chiefly consists in persuading or forcing other people to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2848,be as good as ourselves. It is not progress that we object to; on the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2849,"contrary, we flatter ourselves that we are the most progressive people"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2850,who ever lived. It is individuality that we war against: we should think
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2851,we had done wonders if we had made ourselves all alike; forgetting that
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2852,the unlikeness of one person to another is generally the first thing
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2853,"which draws the attention of either to the imperfection of his own type,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2854,"and the superiority of another, or the possibility, by combining the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2855,"advantages of both, of producing something better than either. We have a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2856,"warning example in China--a nation of much talent, and, in some"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2857,"respects, even wisdom, owing to the rare good fortune of having been"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2858,"provided at an early period with a particularly good set of customs, the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2859,"work, in some measure, of men to whom even the most enlightened European"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2860,"must accord, under certain limitations, the title of sages and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2861,"philosophers. They are remarkable, too, in the excellence of their"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2862,"apparatus for impressing, as far as possible, the best wisdom they"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2863,"possess upon every mind in the community, and securing that those who"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2864,have appropriated most of it shall occupy the posts of honour and power.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2865,Surely the people who did this have discovered the secret of human
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2866,"progressiveness, and must have kept themselves steadily at the head of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2867,"the movement of the world. On the contrary, they have become"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2868,stationary--have remained so for thousands of years; and if they are
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2869,"ever to be farther improved, it must be by foreigners. They have"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2870,succeeded beyond all hope in what English philanthropists are so
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2871,"industriously working at--in making a people all alike, all governing"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2872,their thoughts and conduct by the same maxims and rules; and these are
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2873,"the fruits. The modern _regime_ of public opinion is, in an unorganised"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2874,"form, what the Chinese educational and political systems are in an"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2875,organised; and unless individuality shall be able successfully to assert
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2876,"itself against this yoke, Europe, notwithstanding its noble antecedents"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2877,"and its professed Christianity, will tend to become another China."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2878,What is it that has hitherto preserved Europe from this lot? What has
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2879,"made the European family of nations an improving, instead of a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2880,"stationary portion of mankind? Not any superior excellence in them,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2881,"which, when it exists, exists as the effect, not as the cause; but their"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2882,"remarkable diversity of character and culture. Individuals, classes,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2883,"nations, have been extremely unlike one another: they have struck out a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2884,"great variety of paths, each leading to something valuable; and although"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2885,at every period those who travelled in different paths have been
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2886,"intolerant of one another, and each would have thought it an excellent"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2887,"thing if all the rest could have been compelled to travel his road,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2888,their attempts to thwart each other's development have rarely had any
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2889,"permanent success, and each has in time endured to receive the good"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2890,"which the others have offered. Europe is, in my judgment, wholly"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2891,indebted to this plurality of paths for its progressive and many-sided
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2892,development. But it already begins to possess this benefit in a
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2893,considerably less degree. It is decidedly advancing towards the Chinese
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2894,"ideal of making all people alike. M. de Tocqueville, in his last"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2895,"important work, remarks how much more the Frenchmen of the present day"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2896,"resemble one another, than did those even of the last generation. The"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2897,same remark might be made of Englishmen in a far greater degree. In a
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2898,"passage already quoted from Wilhelm von Humboldt, he points out two"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2899,"things as necessary conditions of human development, because necessary"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2900,"to render people unlike one another; namely, freedom, and variety of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2901,situations. The second of these two conditions is in this country every
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2902,day diminishing. The circumstances which surround different classes and
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2903,"individuals, and shape their characters, are daily becoming more"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2904,"assimilated. Formerly, different ranks, different neighbourhoods,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2905,"different trades and professions, lived in what might be called"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2906,"different worlds; at present, to a great degree in the same."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2907,"Comparatively speaking, they now read the same things, listen to the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2908,"same things, see the same things, go to the same places, have their"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2909,"hopes and fears directed to the same objects, have the same rights and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2910,"liberties, and the same means of asserting them. Great as are the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2911,"differences of position which remain, they are nothing to those which"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2912,have ceased. And the assimilation is still proceeding. All the political
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2913,"changes of the age promote it, since they all tend to raise the low and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2914,"to lower the high. Every extension of education promotes it, because"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2915,"education brings people under common influences, and gives them access"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2916,to the general stock of facts and sentiments. Improvements in the means
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2917,"of communication promote it, by bringing the inhabitants of distant"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2918,"places into personal contact, and keeping up a rapid flow of changes of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2919,residence between one place and another. The increase of commerce and
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2920,"manufactures promotes it, by diffusing more widely the advantages of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2921,"easy circumstances, and opening all objects of ambition, even the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2922,"highest, to general competition, whereby the desire of rising becomes no"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2923,"longer the character of a particular class, but of all classes. A more"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2924,"powerful agency than even all these, in bringing about a general"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2925,"similarity among mankind, is the complete establishment, in this and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2926,"other free countries, of the ascendency of public opinion in the State."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2927,As the various social eminences which enabled persons entrenched on them
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2928,"to disregard the opinion of the multitude, gradually become levelled; as"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2929,"the very idea of resisting the will of the public, when it is positively"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2930,"known that they have a will, disappears more and more from the minds of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2931,practical politicians; there ceases to be any social support for
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2932,"non-conformity--any substantive power in society, which, itself opposed"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2933,"to the ascendency of numbers, is interested in taking under its"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2934,protection opinions and tendencies at variance with those of the public.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2935,The combination of all these causes forms so great a mass of influences
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2936,"hostile to Individuality, that it is not easy to see how it can stand"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2937,"its ground. It will do so with increasing difficulty, unless the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2938,intelligent part of the public can be made to feel its value--to see
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2939,"that it is good there should be differences, even though not for the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2940,"better, even though, as it may appear to them, some should be for the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2941,"worse. If the claims of Individuality are ever to be asserted, the time"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2942,"is now, while much is still wanting to complete the enforced"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2943,assimilation. It is only in the earlier stages that any stand can be
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2944,successfully made against the encroachment. The demand that all other
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2945,"people shall resemble ourselves, grows by what it feeds on. If"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2946,"resistance waits till life is reduced _nearly_ to one uniform type, all"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2947,"deviations from that type will come to be considered impious, immoral,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2948,even monstrous and contrary to nature. Mankind speedily become unable to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2949,"conceive diversity, when they have been for some time unaccustomed to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2950,see it.

John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2966,extraordinary want of knowledge of human nature and life which

John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2969,among the vulgar with regard to human liberty. So far from setting any
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,3,2970,value on individuality--so far from respecting the rights of each

John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,2980,CHAPTER IV.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,2981,OF THE LIMITS TO THE AUTHORITY OF SOCIETY OVER THE INDIVIDUAL.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,2982,"What, then, is the rightful limit to the sovereignty of the individual"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,2983,over himself? Where does the authority of society begin? How much of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,2984,"human life should be assigned to individuality, and how much to society?"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,2985,"Each will receive its proper share, if each has that which more"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,2986,particularly concerns it. To individuality should belong the part of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,2987,life in which it is chiefly the individual that is interested; to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,2988,"society, the part which chiefly interests society."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,2989,"Though society is not founded on a contract, and though no good purpose"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,2990,is answered by inventing a contract in order to deduce social
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,2991,"obligations from it, every one who receives the protection of society"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,2992,"owes a return for the benefit, and the fact of living in society renders"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,2993,it indispensable that each should be bound to observe a certain line of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,2994,"conduct towards the rest. This conduct consists, first, in not injuring"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,2995,"the interests of one another; or rather certain interests which, either"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,2996,"by express legal provision or by tacit understanding, ought to be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,2997,"considered as rights; and secondly, in each person's bearing his share"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,2998,(to be fixed on some equitable principle) of the labours and sacrifices
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,2999,incurred for defending the society or its members from injury and
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3000,"molestation. These conditions society is justified in enforcing, at all"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3001,costs to those who endeavour to withhold fulfilment. Nor is this all
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3002,"that society may do. The acts of an individual may be hurtful to others,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3003,"or wanting in due consideration for their welfare, without going the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3004,length of violating any of their constituted rights. The offender may
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3005,then be justly punished by opinion though not by law. As soon as any
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3006,part of a person's conduct affects prejudicially the interests of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3007,"others, society has jurisdiction over it, and the question whether the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3008,"general welfare will or will not be promoted by interfering with it,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3009,becomes open to discussion. But there is no room for entertaining any
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3010,such question when a person's conduct affects the interests of no
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3011,"persons besides himself, or needs not affect them unless they like (all"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3012,"the persons concerned being of full age, and the ordinary amount of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3013,"understanding). In all such cases there should be perfect freedom, legal"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3014,"and social, to do the action and stand the consequences."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3015,"It would be a great misunderstanding of this doctrine, to suppose that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3016,"it is one of selfish indifference, which pretends that human beings have"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3017,"no business with each other's conduct in life, and that they should not"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3018,"concern themselves about the well-doing or well-being of one another,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3019,"unless their own interest is involved. Instead of any diminution, there"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3020,is need of a great increase of disinterested exertion to promote the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3021,good of others. But disinterested benevolence can find other instruments
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3022,"to persuade people to their good, than whips and scourges, either of the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3023,literal or the metaphorical sort. I am the last person to undervalue the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3024,"self-regarding virtues; they are only second in importance, if even"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3025,"second, to the social. It is equally the business of education to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3026,cultivate both. But even education works by conviction and persuasion as
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3027,"well as by compulsion, and it is by the former only that, when the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3028,"period of education is past, the self-regarding virtues should be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3029,inculcated. Human beings owe to each other help to distinguish the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3030,"better from the worse, and encouragement to choose the former and avoid"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3031,the latter. They should be for ever stimulating each other to increased
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3032,"exercise of their higher faculties, and increased direction of their"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3033,"feelings and aims towards wise instead of foolish, elevating instead of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3034,"degrading, objects and contemplations. But neither one person, nor any"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3035,"number of persons, is warranted in saying to another human creature of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3036,"ripe years, that he shall not do with his life for his own benefit what"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3037,he chooses to do with it. He is the person most interested in his own
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3038,"well-being: the interest which any other person, except in cases of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3039,"strong personal attachment, can have in it, is trifling, compared with"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3040,that which he himself has; the interest which society has in him
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3041,"individually (except as to his conduct to others) is fractional, and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3042,"altogether indirect: while, with respect to his own feelings and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3043,"circumstances, the most ordinary man or woman has means of knowledge"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3044,immeasurably surpassing those that can be possessed by any one else. The
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3045,interference of society to overrule his judgment and purposes in what
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3046,"only regards himself, must be grounded on general presumptions; which"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3047,"may be altogether wrong, and even if right, are as likely as not to be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3048,"misapplied to individual cases, by persons no better acquainted with the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3049,circumstances of such cases than those are who look at them merely from
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3050,"without. In this department, therefore, of human affairs, Individuality"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3051,has its proper field of action. In the conduct of human beings towards
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3052,"one another, it is necessary that general rules should for the most part"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3053,"be observed, in order that people may know what they have to expect; but"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3054,"in each person's own concerns, his individual spontaneity is entitled to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3055,"free exercise. Considerations to aid his judgment, exhortations to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3056,"strengthen his will, may be offered to him, even obtruded on him, by"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3057,others; but he himself is the final judge. All errors which he is likely
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3058,"to commit against advice and warning, are far outweighed by the evil of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3059,allowing others to constrain him to what they deem his good.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3060,I do not mean that the feelings with which a person is regarded by
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3061,"others, ought not to be in any way affected by his self-regarding"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3062,qualities or deficiencies. This is neither possible nor desirable. If he
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3063,"is eminent in any of the qualities which conduce to his own good, he is,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3064,"so far, a proper object of admiration. He is so much the nearer to the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3065,ideal perfection of human nature. If he is grossly deficient in those
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3066,"qualities, a sentiment the opposite of admiration will follow. There is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3067,"a degree of folly, and a degree of what may be called (though the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3068,"phrase is not unobjectionable) lowness or depravation of taste, which,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3069,"though it cannot justify doing harm to the person who manifests it,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3070,"renders him necessarily and properly a subject of distaste, or, in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3071,"extreme cases, even of contempt: a person could not have the opposite"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3072,qualities in due strength without entertaining these feelings. Though
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3073,"doing no wrong to any one, a person may so act as to compel us to judge"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3074,"him, and feel to him, as a fool, or as a being of an inferior order: and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3075,since this judgment and feeling are a fact which he would prefer to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3076,"avoid, it is doing him a service to warn him of it beforehand, as of any"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3077,other disagreeable consequence to which he exposes himself. It would be
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3078,"well, indeed, if this good office were much more freely rendered than"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3079,"the common notions of politeness at present permit, and if one person"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3080,"could honestly point out to another that he thinks him in fault, without"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3081,"being considered unmannerly or presuming. We have a right, also, in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3082,"various ways, to act upon our unfavourable opinion of any one, not to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3083,"the oppression of his individuality, but in the exercise of ours. We are"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3084,"not bound, for example, to seek his society; we have a right to avoid it"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3085,"(though not to parade the avoidance), for we have a right to choose the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3086,"society most acceptable to us. We have a right, and it may be our duty,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3087,"to caution others against him, if we think his example or conversation"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3088,likely to have a pernicious effect on those with whom he associates. We
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3089,"may give others a preference over him in optional good offices, except"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3090,those which tend to his improvement. In these various modes a person may
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3091,"suffer very severe penalties at the hands of others, for faults which"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3092,directly concern only himself; but he suffers these penalties only in so
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3093,"far as they are the natural, and, as it were, the spontaneous"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3094,"consequences of the faults themselves, not because they are purposely"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3095,inflicted on him for the sake of punishment. A person who shows
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3096,"rashness, obstinacy, self-conceit--who cannot live within moderate"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3097,means--who cannot restrain himself from hurtful indulgences--who pursues
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3098,animal pleasures at the expense of those of feeling and intellect--must
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3099,"expect to be lowered in the opinion of others, and to have a less share"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3100,"of their favourable sentiments; but of this he has no right to complain,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3101,unless he has merited their favour by special excellence in his social
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3102,"relations, and has thus established a title to their good offices, which"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3103,is not affected by his demerits towards himself.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3104,"What I contend for is, that the inconveniences which are strictly"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3105,"inseparable from the unfavourable judgment of others, are the only ones"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3106,to which a person should ever be subjected for that portion of his
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3107,"conduct and character which concerns his own good, but which does not"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3108,affect the interests of others in their relations with him. Acts
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3109,injurious to others require a totally different treatment. Encroachment
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3110,on their rights; infliction on them of any loss or damage not justified
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3111,by his own rights; falsehood or duplicity in dealing with them; unfair
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3112,or ungenerous use of advantages over them; even selfish abstinence from
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3113,defending them against injury--these are fit objects of moral
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3114,"reprobation, and, in grave cases, of moral retribution and punishment."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3115,"And not only these acts, but the dispositions which lead to them, are"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3116,"properly immoral, and fit subjects of disapprobation which may rise to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3117,abhorrence. Cruelty of disposition; malice and ill-nature; that most
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3118,"anti-social and odious of all passions, envy; dissimulation and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3119,"insincerity; irascibility on insufficient cause, and resentment"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3120,disproportioned to the provocation; the love of domineering over others;
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3121,the desire to engross more than one's share of advantages (the [Greek:
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3122,pleonexia] of the Greeks); the pride which derives gratification from
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3123,the abasement of others; the egotism which thinks self and its concerns
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3124,"more important than everything else, and decides all doubtful questions"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3125,"in its own favour;--these are moral vices, and constitute a bad and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3126,odious moral character: unlike the self-regarding faults previously
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3127,"mentioned, which are not properly immoralities, and to whatever pitch"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3128,"they may be carried, do not constitute wickedness. They may be proofs of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3129,"any amount of folly, or want of personal dignity and self-respect; but"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3130,they are only a subject of moral reprobation when they involve a breach
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3131,"of duty to others, for whose sake the individual is bound to have care"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3132,for himself. What are called duties to ourselves are not socially
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3133,"obligatory, unless circumstances render them at the same time duties to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3134,"others. The term duty to oneself, when it means anything more than"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3135,"prudence, means self-respect or self-development; and for none of these"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3136,"is any one accountable to his fellow-creatures, because for none of them"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3137,is it for the good of mankind that he be held accountable to them.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3138,The distinction between the loss of consideration which a person may
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3139,"rightly incur by defect of prudence or of personal dignity, and the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3140,reprobation which is due to him for an offence against the rights of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3141,"others, is not a merely nominal distinction. It makes a vast difference"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3142,"both in our feelings and in our conduct towards him, whether he"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3143,displeases us in things in which we think we have a right to control
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3144,"him, or in things in which we know that we have not. If he displeases"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3145,"us, we may express our distaste, and we may stand aloof from a person as"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3146,well as from a thing that displeases us; but we shall not therefore feel
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3147,called on to make his life uncomfortable. We shall reflect that he
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3148,"already bears, or will bear, the whole penalty of his error; if he"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3149,"spoils his life by mismanagement, we shall not, for that reason, desire"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3150,"to spoil it still further: instead of wishing to punish him, we shall"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3151,"rather endeavour to alleviate his punishment, by showing him how he may"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3152,avoid or cure the evils his conduct tends to bring upon him. He may be
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3153,"to us an object of pity, perhaps of dislike, but not of anger or"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3154,resentment; we shall not treat him like an enemy of society: the worst
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3155,"we shall think ourselves justified in doing is leaving him to himself,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3156,if we do not interfere benevolently by showing interest or concern for
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3157,him. It is far otherwise if he has infringed the rules necessary for the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3158,"protection of his fellow-creatures, individually or collectively. The"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3159,"evil consequences of his acts do not then fall on himself, but on"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3160,"others; and society, as the protector of all its members, must retaliate"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3161,"on him; must inflict pain on him for the express purpose of punishment,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3162,"and must take care that it be sufficiently severe. In the one case, he"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3163,"is an offender at our bar, and we are called on not only to sit in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3164,"judgment on him, but, in one shape or another, to execute our own"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3165,"sentence: in the other case, it is not our part to inflict any suffering"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3166,"on him, except what may incidentally follow from our using the same"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3167,"liberty in the regulation of our own affairs, which we allow to him in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3168,his.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3169,The distinction here pointed out between the part of a person's life
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3170,"which concerns only himself, and that which concerns others, many"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3171,persons will refuse to admit. How (it may be asked) can any part of the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3172,conduct of a member of society be a matter of indifference to the other
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3173,members? No person is an entirely isolated being; it is impossible for a
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3174,"person to do anything seriously or permanently hurtful to himself,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3175,"without mischief reaching at least to his near connections, and often"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3176,"far beyond them. If he injures his property, he does harm to those who"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3177,"directly or indirectly derived support from it, and usually diminishes,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3178,"by a greater or less amount, the general resources of the community. If"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3179,"he deteriorates his bodily or mental faculties, he not only brings evil"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3180,"upon all who depended on him for any portion of their happiness, but"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3181,disqualifies himself for rendering the services which he owes to his
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3182,fellow-creatures generally; perhaps becomes a burthen on their affection
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3183,"or benevolence; and if such conduct were very frequent, hardly any"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3184,offence that is committed would detract more from the general sum of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3185,"good. Finally, if by his vices or follies a person does no direct harm"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3186,"to others, he is nevertheless (it may be said) injurious by his example;"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3187,"and ought to be compelled to control himself, for the sake of those whom"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3188,the sight or knowledge of his conduct might corrupt or mislead.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3189,And even (it will be added) if the consequences of misconduct could be
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3190,"confined to the vicious or thoughtless individual, ought society to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3191,abandon to their own guidance those who are manifestly unfit for it? If
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3192,protection against themselves is confessedly due to children and persons
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3193,"under age, is not society equally bound to afford it to persons of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3194,"mature years who are equally incapable of self-government? If gambling,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3195,"or drunkenness, or incontinence, or idleness, or uncleanliness, are as"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3196,"injurious to happiness, and as great a hindrance to improvement, as many"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3197,"or most of the acts prohibited by law, why (it may be asked) should not"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3198,"law, so far as is consistent with practicability and social convenience,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3199,endeavour to repress these also? And as a supplement to the unavoidable
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3200,"imperfections of law, ought not opinion at least to organise a powerful"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3201,"police against these vices, and visit rigidly with social penalties"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3202,those who are known to practise them? There is no question here (it may
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3203,"be said) about restricting individuality, or impeding the trial of new"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3204,and original experiments in living. The only things it is sought to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3205,prevent are things which have been tried and condemned from the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3206,beginning of the world until now; things which experience has shown not
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3207,to be useful or suitable to any person's individuality. There must be
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3208,"some length of time and amount of experience, after which a moral or"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3209,prudential truth may be regarded as established: and it is merely
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3210,desired to prevent generation after generation from falling over the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3211,same precipice which has been fatal to their predecessors.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3212,"I fully admit that the mischief which a person does to himself, may"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3213,"seriously affect, both through their sympathies and their interests,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3214,"those nearly connected with him, and in a minor degree, society at"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3215,"large. When, by conduct of this sort, a person is led to violate a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3216,"distinct and assignable obligation to any other person or persons, the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3217,"case is taken out of the self-regarding class, and becomes amenable to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3218,"moral disapprobation in the proper sense of the term. If, for example,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3219,"a man, through intemperance or extravagance, becomes unable to pay his"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3220,"debts, or, having undertaken the moral responsibility of a family,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3221,"becomes from the same cause incapable of supporting or educating them,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3222,"he is deservedly reprobated, and might be justly punished; but it is for"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3223,"the breach of duty to his family or creditors, not for the extravagance."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3224,"If the resources which ought to have been devoted to them, had been"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3225,"diverted from them for the most prudent investment, the moral"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3226,culpability would have been the same. George Barnwell murdered his uncle
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3227,"to get money for his mistress, but if he had done it to set himself up"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3228,"in business, he would equally have been hanged. Again, in the frequent"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3229,"case of a man who causes grief to his family by addiction to bad habits,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3230,he deserves reproach for his unkindness or ingratitude; but so he may
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3231,"for cultivating habits not in themselves vicious, if they are painful to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3232,"those with whom he passes his life, or who from personal ties are"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3233,dependent on him for their comfort. Whoever fails in the consideration
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3234,"generally due to the interests and feelings of others, not being"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3235,"compelled by some more imperative duty, or justified by allowable"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3236,"self-preference, is a subject of moral disapprobation for that failure,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3237,"but not for the cause of it, nor for the errors, merely personal to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3238,"himself, which may have remotely led to it. In like manner, when a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3239,"person disables himself, by conduct purely self-regarding, from the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3240,"performance of some definite duty incumbent on him to the public, he is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3241,guilty of a social offence. No person ought to be punished simply for
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3242,being drunk; but a soldier or a policeman should be punished for being
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3243,"drunk on duty. Whenever, in short, there is a definite damage, or a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3244,"definite risk of damage, either to an individual or to the public, the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3245,"case is taken out of the province of liberty, and placed in that of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3246,morality or law.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3247,"But with regard to the merely contingent, or, as it may be called,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3248,"constructive injury which a person causes to society, by conduct which"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3249,"neither violates any specific duty to the public, nor occasions"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3250,perceptible hurt to any assignable individual except himself; the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3251,"inconvenience is one which society can afford to bear, for the sake of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3252,the greater good of human freedom. If grown persons are to be punished
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3253,"for not taking proper care of themselves, I would rather it were for"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3254,"their own sake, than under pretence of preventing them from impairing"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3255,their capacity of rendering to society benefits which society does not
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3256,pretend it has a right to exact. But I cannot consent to argue the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3257,point as if society had no means of bringing its weaker members up to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3258,"its ordinary standard of rational conduct, except waiting till they do"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3259,"something irrational, and then punishing them, legally or morally, for"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3260,it. Society has had absolute power over them during all the early
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3261,portion of their existence: it has had the whole period of childhood and
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3262,nonage in which to try whether it could make them capable of rational
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3263,conduct in life. The existing generation is master both of the training
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3264,and the entire circumstances of the generation to come; it cannot indeed
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3265,"make them perfectly wise and good, because it is itself so lamentably"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3266,"deficient in goodness and wisdom; and its best efforts are not always,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3267,"in individual cases, its most successful ones; but it is perfectly well"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3268,"able to make the rising generation, as a whole, as good as, and a little"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3269,"better than, itself. If society lets any considerable number of its"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3270,"members grow up mere children, incapable of being acted on by rational"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3271,"consideration of distant motives, society has itself to blame for the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3272,"consequences. Armed not only with all the powers of education, but with"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3273,the ascendency which the authority of a received opinion always
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3274,exercises over the minds who are least fitted to judge for themselves;
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3275,and aided by the _natural_ penalties which cannot be prevented from
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3276,falling on those who incur the distaste or the contempt of those who
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3277,"know them; let not society pretend that it needs, besides all this, the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3278,power to issue commands and enforce obedience in the personal concerns
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3279,"of individuals, in which, on all principles of justice and policy, the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3280,decision ought to rest with those who are to abide the consequences. Nor
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3281,is there anything which tends more to discredit and frustrate the better
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3282,"means of influencing conduct, than a resort to the worse. If there be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3283,"among those whom it is attempted to coerce into prudence or temperance,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3284,any of the material of which vigorous and independent characters are
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3285,"made, they will infallibly rebel against the yoke. No such person will"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3286,"ever feel that others have a right to control him in his concerns, such"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3287,as they have to prevent him from injuring them in theirs; and it easily
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3288,comes to be considered a mark of spirit and courage to fly in the face
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3289,"of such usurped authority, and do with ostentation the exact opposite of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3290,"what it enjoins; as in the fashion of grossness which succeeded, in the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3291,"time of Charles II., to the fanatical moral intolerance of the Puritans."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3292,With respect to what is said of the necessity of protecting society
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3293,from the bad example set to others by the vicious or the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3294,self-indulgent; it is true that bad example may have a pernicious
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3295,"effect, especially the example of doing wrong to others with impunity to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3296,"the wrong-doer. But we are now speaking of conduct which, while it does"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3297,"no wrong to others, is supposed to do great harm to the agent himself:"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3298,"and I do not see how those who believe this, can think otherwise than"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3299,"that the example, on the whole, must be more salutary than hurtful,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3300,"since, if it displays the misconduct, it displays also the painful or"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3301,"degrading consequences which, if the conduct is justly censured, must be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3302,supposed to be in all or most cases attendant on it.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3303,But the strongest of all the arguments against the interference of the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3304,"public with purely personal conduct, is that when it does interfere, the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3305,"odds are that it interferes wrongly, and in the wrong place. On"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3306,"questions of social morality, of duty to others, the opinion of the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3307,"public, that is, of an overruling majority, though often wrong, is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3308,likely to be still oftener right; because on such questions they are
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3309,only required to judge of their own interests; of the manner in which
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3310,"some mode of conduct, if allowed to be practised, would affect"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3311,"themselves. But the opinion of a similar majority, imposed as a law on"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3312,"the minority, on questions of self-regarding conduct, is quite as"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3313,"likely to be wrong as right; for in these cases public opinion means, at"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3314,"the best, some people's opinion of what is good or bad for other people;"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3315,"while very often it does not even mean that; the public, with the most"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3316,"perfect indifference, passing over the pleasure or convenience of those"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3317,"whose conduct they censure, and considering only their own preference."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3318,There are many who consider as an injury to themselves any conduct which
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3319,"they have a distaste for, and resent it as an outrage to their feelings;"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3320,"as a religious bigot, when charged with disregarding the religious"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3321,"feelings of others, has been known to retort that they disregard his"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3322,"feelings, by persisting in their abominable worship or creed. But there"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3323,"is no parity between the feeling of a person for his own opinion, and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3324,the feeling of another who is offended at his holding it; no more than
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3325,"between the desire of a thief to take a purse, and the desire of the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3326,right owner to keep it. And a person's taste is as much his own peculiar
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3327,concern as his opinion or his purse. It is easy for any one to imagine
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3328,"an ideal public, which leaves the freedom and choice of individuals in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3329,"all uncertain matters undisturbed, and only requires them to abstain"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3330,from modes of conduct which universal experience has condemned. But
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3331,where has there been seen a public which set any such limit to its
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3332,censorship? or when does the public trouble itself about universal
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3333,experience? In its interferences with personal conduct it is seldom
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3334,thinking of anything but the enormity of acting or feeling differently
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3335,"from itself; and this standard of judgment, thinly disguised, is held up"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3336,"to mankind as the dictate of religion and philosophy, by nine-tenths of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3337,all moralists and speculative writers. These teach that things are right
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3338,because they are right; because we feel them to be so. They tell us to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3339,search in our own minds and hearts for laws of conduct binding on
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3340,ourselves and on all others. What can the poor public do but apply these
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3341,"instructions, and make their own personal feelings of good and evil, if"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3342,"they are tolerably unanimous in them, obligatory on all the world?"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3343,The evil here pointed out is not one which exists only in theory; and it
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3344,may perhaps be expected that I should specify the instances in which the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3345,public of this age and country improperly invests its own preferences
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3346,with the character of moral laws. I am not writing an essay on the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3347,aberrations of existing moral feeling. That is too weighty a subject to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3348,"be discussed parenthetically, and by way of illustration. Yet examples"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3349,"are necessary, to show that the principle I maintain is of serious and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3350,"practical moment, and that I am not endeavouring to erect a barrier"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3351,"against imaginary evils. And it is not difficult to show, by abundant"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3352,"instances, that to extend the bounds of what may be called moral police,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3353,until it encroaches on the most unquestionably legitimate liberty of the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3354,"individual, is one of the most universal of all human propensities."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3355,"As a first instance, consider the antipathies which men cherish on no"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3356,better grounds than that persons whose religious opinions are different
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3357,"from theirs, do not practise their religious observances, especially"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3358,"their religious abstinences. To cite a rather trivial example, nothing"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3359,in the creed or practice of Christians does more to envenom the hatred
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3360,"of Mahomedans against them, than the fact of their eating pork. There"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3361,are few acts which Christians and Europeans regard with more unaffected
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3362,"disgust, than Mussulmans regard this particular mode of satisfying"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3363,"hunger. It is, in the first place, an offence against their religion;"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3364,but this circumstance by no means explains either the degree or the kind
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3365,"of their repugnance; for wine also is forbidden by their religion, and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3366,"to partake of it is by all Mussulmans accounted wrong, but not"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3367,"disgusting. Their aversion to the flesh of the ""unclean beast"" is, on"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3368,"the contrary, of that peculiar character, resembling an instinctive"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3369,"antipathy, which the idea of uncleanness, when once it thoroughly sinks"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3370,"into the feelings, seems always to excite even in those whose personal"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3371,"habits are anything but scrupulously cleanly, and of which the sentiment"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3372,"of religious impurity, so intense in the Hindoos, is a remarkable"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3373,"example. Suppose now that in a people, of whom the majority were"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3374,"Mussulmans, that majority should insist upon not permitting pork to be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3375,eaten within the limits of the country. This would be nothing new in
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3376,Mahomedan countries.[14] Would it be a legitimate exercise of the moral
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3377,"authority of public opinion? and if not, why not? The practice is really"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3378,revolting to such a public. They also sincerely think that it is
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3379,forbidden and abhorred by the Deity. Neither could the prohibition be
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3380,"censured as religious persecution. It might be religious in its origin,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3381,"but it would not be persecution for religion, since nobody's religion"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3382,makes it a duty to eat pork. The only tenable ground of condemnation
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3383,"would be, that with the personal tastes and self-regarding concerns of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3384,individuals the public has no business to interfere.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3385,To come somewhat nearer home: the majority of Spaniards consider it a
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3386,"gross impiety, offensive in the highest degree to the Supreme Being, to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3387,worship him in any other manner than the Roman Catholic; and no other
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3388,public worship is lawful on Spanish soil. The people of all Southern
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3389,"Europe look upon a married clergy as not only irreligious, but unchaste,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3390,"indecent, gross, disgusting. What do Protestants think of these"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3391,"perfectly sincere feelings, and of the attempt to enforce them against"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3392,"non-Catholics? Yet, if mankind are justified in interfering with each"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3393,"other's liberty in things which do not concern the interests of others,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3394,on what principle is it possible consistently to exclude these cases? or
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3395,who can blame people for desiring to suppress what they regard as a
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3396,scandal in the sight of God and man? No stronger case can be shown for
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3397,"prohibiting anything which is regarded as a personal immorality, than"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3398,is made out for suppressing these practices in the eyes of those who
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3399,regard them as impieties; and unless we are willing to adopt the logic
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3400,"of persecutors, and to say that we may persecute others because we are"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3401,"right, and that they must not persecute us because they are wrong, we"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3402,must beware of admitting a principle of which we should resent as a
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3403,gross injustice the application to ourselves.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3404,"The preceding instances may be objected to, although unreasonably, as"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3405,"drawn from contingencies impossible among us: opinion, in this country,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3406,"not being likely to enforce abstinence from meats, or to interfere with"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3407,"people for worshipping, and for either marrying or not marrying,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3408,"according to their creed or inclination. The next example, however,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3409,shall be taken from an interference with liberty which we have by no
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3410,means passed all danger of. Wherever the Puritans have been sufficiently
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3411,"powerful, as in New England, and in Great Britain at the time of the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3412,"Commonwealth, they have endeavoured, with considerable success, to put"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3413,"down all public, and nearly all private, amusements: especially music,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3414,"dancing, public games, or other assemblages for purposes of diversion,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3415,and the theatre. There are still in this country large bodies of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3416,persons by whose notions of morality and religion these recreations are
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3417,"condemned; and those persons belonging chiefly to the middle class, who"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3418,are the ascendant power in the present social and political condition of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3419,"the kingdom, it is by no means impossible that persons of these"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3420,sentiments may at some time or other command a majority in Parliament.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3421,How will the remaining portion of the community like to have the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3422,amusements that shall be permitted to them regulated by the religious
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3423,and moral sentiments of the stricter Calvinists and Methodists? Would
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3424,"they not, with considerable peremptoriness, desire these intrusively"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3425,pious members of society to mind their own business? This is precisely
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3426,"what should be said to every government and every public, who have the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3427,pretension that no person shall enjoy any pleasure which they think
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3428,"wrong. But if the principle of the pretension be admitted, no one can"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3429,"reasonably object to its being acted on in the sense of the majority, or"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3430,other preponderating power in the country; and all persons must be ready
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3431,"to conform to the idea of a Christian commonwealth, as understood by the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3432,"early settlers in New England, if a religious profession similar to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3433,"theirs should ever succeed in regaining its lost ground, as religions"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3434,supposed to be declining have so often been known to do.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3435,"To imagine another contingency, perhaps more likely to be realised than"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3436,the one last mentioned. There is confessedly a strong tendency in the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3437,"modern world towards a democratic constitution of society, accompanied"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3438,or not by popular political institutions. It is affirmed that in the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3439,country where this tendency is most completely realised--where both
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3440,society and the government are most democratic--the United States--the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3441,"feeling of the majority, to whom any appearance of a more showy or"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3442,"costly style of living than they can hope to rival is disagreeable,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3443,"operates as a tolerably effectual sumptuary law, and that in many parts"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3444,of the Union it is really difficult for a person possessing a very large
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3445,"income, to find any mode of spending it, which will not incur popular"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3446,disapprobation. Though such statements as these are doubtless much
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3447,"exaggerated as a representation of existing facts, the state of things"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3448,"they describe is not only a conceivable and possible, but a probable"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3449,"result of democratic feeling, combined with the notion that the public"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3450,has a right to a veto on the manner in which individuals shall spend
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3451,their incomes. We have only further to suppose a considerable diffusion
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3452,"of Socialist opinions, and it may become infamous in the eyes of the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3453,"majority to possess more property than some very small amount, or any"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3454,income not earned by manual labour. Opinions similar in principle to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3455,"these, already prevail widely among the artisan class, and weigh"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3456,oppressively on those who are amenable to the opinion chiefly of that
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3457,"class, namely, its own members. It is known that the bad workmen who"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3458,"form the majority of the operatives in many branches of industry, are"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3459,decidedly of opinion that bad workmen ought to receive the same wages as
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3460,"good, and that no one ought to be allowed, through piecework or"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3461,"otherwise, to earn by superior skill or industry more than others can"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3462,"without it. And they employ a moral police, which occasionally becomes a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3463,"physical one, to deter skilful workmen from receiving, and employers"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3464,"from giving, a larger remuneration for a more useful service. If the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3465,"public have any jurisdiction over private concerns, I cannot see that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3466,"these people are in fault, or that any individual's particular public"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3467,can be blamed for asserting the same authority over his individual
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3468,"conduct, which the general public asserts over people in general."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3469,"But, without dwelling upon supposititious cases, there are, in our own"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3470,"day, gross usurpations upon the liberty of private life actually"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3471,"practised, and still greater ones threatened with some expectation of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3472,"success, and opinions proposed which assert an unlimited right in the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3473,"public not only to prohibit by law everything which it thinks wrong, but"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3474,"in order to get at what it thinks wrong, to prohibit any number of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3475,things which it admits to be innocent.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3476,"Under the name of preventing intemperance, the people of one English"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3477,"colony, and of nearly half the United States, have been interdicted by"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3478,"law from making any use whatever of fermented drinks, except for medical"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3479,"purposes: for prohibition of their sale is in fact, as it is intended to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3480,"be, prohibition of their use. And though the impracticability of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3481,executing the law has caused its repeal in several of the States which
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3482,"had adopted it, including the one from which it derives its name, an"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3483,"attempt has notwithstanding been commenced, and is prosecuted with"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3484,"considerable zeal by many of the professed philanthropists, to agitate"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3485,"for a similar law in this country. The association, or ""Alliance"" as it"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3486,"terms itself, which has been formed for this purpose, has acquired some"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3487,notoriety through the publicity given to a correspondence between its
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3488,Secretary and one of the very few English public men who hold that a
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3489,politician's opinions ought to be founded on principles. Lord Stanley's
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3490,share in this correspondence is calculated to strengthen the hopes
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3491,"already built on him, by those who know how rare such qualities as are"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3492,"manifested in some of his public appearances, unhappily are among those"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3493,"who figure in political life. The organ of the Alliance, who would"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3494,"""deeply deplore the recognition of any principle which could be wrested"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3495,"to justify bigotry and persecution,"" undertakes to point out the ""broad"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3496,"and impassable barrier"" which divides such principles from those of the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3497,"association. ""All matters relating to thought, opinion, conscience,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3498,"appear to me,"" he says, ""to be without the sphere of legislation; all"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3499,"pertaining to social act, habit, relation, subject only to a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3500,"discretionary power vested in the State itself, and not in the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3501,"individual, to be within it."" No mention is made of a third class,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3502,"different from either of these, viz. acts and habits which are not"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3503,"social, but individual; although it is to this class, surely, that the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3504,"act of drinking fermented liquors belongs. Selling fermented liquors,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3505,"however, is trading, and trading is a social act. But the infringement"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3506,"complained of is not on the liberty of the seller, but on that of the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3507,buyer and consumer; since the State might just as well forbid him to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3508,"drink wine, as purposely make it impossible for him to obtain it. The"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3509,"Secretary, however, says, ""I claim, as a citizen, a right to legislate"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3510,"whenever my social rights are invaded by the social act of another."" And"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3511,"now for the definition of these ""social rights."" ""If anything invades my"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3512,"social rights, certainly the traffic in strong drink does. It destroys"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3513,"my primary right of security, by constantly creating and stimulating"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3514,"social disorder. It invades my right of equality, by deriving a profit"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3515,"from the creation of a misery, I am taxed to support. It impedes my"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3516,"right to free moral and intellectual development, by surrounding my path"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3517,"with dangers, and by weakening and demoralising society, from which I"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3518,"have a right to claim mutual aid and intercourse."" A theory of ""social"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3519,"rights,"" the like of which probably never before found its way into"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3520,distinct language--being nothing short of this--that it is the absolute
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3521,"social right of every individual, that every other individual shall act"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3522,in every respect exactly as he ought; that whosoever fails thereof in
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3523,"the smallest particular, violates my social right, and entitles me to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3524,demand from the legislature the removal of the grievance. So monstrous a
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3525,principle is far more dangerous than any single interference with
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3526,liberty; there is no violation of liberty which it would not justify;
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3527,"it acknowledges no right to any freedom whatever, except perhaps to that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3528,"of holding opinions in secret, without ever disclosing them: for the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3529,"moment an opinion which I consider noxious, passes any one's lips, it"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3530,"invades all the ""social rights"" attributed to me by the Alliance. The"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3531,doctrine ascribes to all mankind a vested interest in each other's
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3532,"moral, intellectual, and even physical perfection, to be defined by each"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3533,claimant according to his own standard.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3534,Another important example of illegitimate interference with the rightful
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3535,"liberty of the individual, not simply threatened, but long since carried"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3536,"into triumphant effect, is Sabbatarian legislation. Without doubt,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3537,"abstinence on one day in the week, so far as the exigencies of life"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3538,"permit, from the usual daily occupation, though in no respect"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3539,"religiously binding on any except Jews, is a highly beneficial custom."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3540,And inasmuch as this custom cannot be observed without a general consent
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3541,"to that effect among the industrious classes, therefore, in so far as"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3542,"some persons by working may impose the same necessity on others, it may"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3543,"be allowable and right that the law should guarantee to each, the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3544,"observance by others of the custom, by suspending the greater operations"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3545,"of industry on a particular day. But this justification, grounded on the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3546,direct interest which others have in each individual's observance of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3547,"the practice, does not apply to the self-chosen occupations in which a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3548,"person may think fit to employ his leisure; nor does it hold good, in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3549,"the smallest degree, for legal restrictions on amusements. It is true"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3550,that the amusement of some is the day's work of others; but the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3551,"pleasure, not to say the useful recreation, of many, is worth the labour"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3552,"of a few, provided the occupation is freely chosen, and can be freely"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3553,resigned. The operatives are perfectly right in thinking that if all
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3554,"worked on Sunday, seven days' work would have to be given for six days'"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3555,"wages: but so long as the great mass of employments are suspended, the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3556,"small number who for the enjoyment of others must still work, obtain a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3557,proportional increase of earnings; and they are not obliged to follow
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3558,"those occupations, if they prefer leisure to emolument. If a further"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3559,"remedy is sought, it might be found in the establishment by custom of a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3560,holiday on some other day of the week for those particular classes of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3561,"persons. The only ground, therefore, on which restrictions on Sunday"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3562,"amusements can be defended, must be that they are religiously wrong; a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3563,motive of legislation which never can be too earnestly protested
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3564,"against. ""Deorum injuriae Diis curae."" It remains to be proved that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3565,society or any of its officers holds a commission from on high to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3566,"avenge any supposed offence to Omnipotence, which is not also a wrong to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3567,our fellow-creatures. The notion that it is one man's duty that another
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3568,"should be religious, was the foundation of all the religious"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3569,"persecutions ever perpetrated, and if admitted, would fully justify"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3570,them. Though the feeling which breaks out in the repeated attempts to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3571,"stop railway travelling on Sunday, in the resistance to the opening of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3572,"Museums, and the like, has not the cruelty of the old persecutors, the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3573,state of mind indicated by it is fundamentally the same. It is a
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3574,determination not to tolerate others in doing what is permitted by their
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3575,"religion, because it is not permitted by the persecutor's religion. It"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3576,"is a belief that God not only abominates the act of the misbeliever, but"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3577,will not hold us guiltless if we leave him unmolested.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3578,I cannot refrain from adding to these examples of the little account
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3579,"commonly made of human liberty, the language of downright persecution"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3580,"which breaks out from the press of this country, whenever it feels"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3581,called on to notice the remarkable phenomenon of Mormonism. Much might
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3582,"be said on the unexpected and instructive fact, that an alleged new"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3583,"revelation, and a religion founded on it, the product of palpable"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3584,"imposture, not even supported by the _prestige_ of extraordinary"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3585,"qualities in its founder, is believed by hundreds of thousands, and has"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3586,"been made the foundation of a society, in the age of newspapers,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3587,"railways, and the electric telegraph. What here concerns us is, that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3588,"this religion, like other and better religions, has its martyrs; that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3589,"its prophet and founder was, for his teaching, put to death by a mob;"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3590,that others of its adherents lost their lives by the same lawless
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3591,"violence; that they were forcibly expelled, in a body, from the country"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3592,"in which they first grew up; while, now that they have been chased into"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3593,"a solitary recess in the midst of a desert, many in this country openly"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3594,declare that it would be right (only that it is not convenient) to send
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3595,"an expedition against them, and compel them by force to conform to the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3596,opinions of other people. The article of the Mormonite doctrine which is
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3597,the chief provocative to the antipathy which thus breaks through the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3598,"ordinary restraints of religious tolerance, is its sanction of polygamy;"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3599,"which, though permitted to Mahomedans, and Hindoos, and Chinese, seems"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3600,to excite unquenchable animosity when practised by persons who speak
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3601,"English, and profess to be a kind of Christians. No one has a deeper"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3602,disapprobation than I have of this Mormon institution; both for other
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3603,"reasons, and because, far from being in any way countenanced by the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3604,"principle of liberty, it is a direct infraction of that principle, being"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3605,"a mere riveting of the chains of one half of the community, and an"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3606,emancipation of the other from reciprocity of obligation towards them.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3607,"Still, it must be remembered that this relation is as much voluntary on"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3608,"the part of the women concerned in it, and who may be deemed the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3609,"sufferers by it, as is the case with any other form of the marriage"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3610,"institution; and however surprising this fact may appear, it has its"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3611,"explanation in the common ideas and customs of the world, which teaching"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3612,"women to think marriage the one thing needful, make it intelligible that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3613,"many a woman should prefer being one of several wives, to not being a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3614,"wife at all. Other countries are not asked to recognise such unions, or"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3615,release any portion of their inhabitants from their own laws on the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3616,score of Mormonite opinions. But when the dissentients have conceded to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3617,"the hostile sentiments of others, far more than could justly be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3618,demanded; when they have left the countries to which their doctrines
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3619,"were unacceptable, and established themselves in a remote corner of the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3620,"earth, which they have been the first to render habitable to human"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3621,beings; it is difficult to see on what principles but those of tyranny
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3622,"they can be prevented from living there under what laws they please,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3623,"provided they commit no aggression on other nations, and allow perfect"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3624,freedom of departure to those who are dissatisfied with their ways. A
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3625,"recent writer, in some respects of considerable merit, proposes (to use"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3626,"his own words), not a crusade, but a _civilizade_, against this"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3627,"polygamous community, to put an end to what seems to him a retrograde"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3628,"step in civilisation. It also appears so to me, but I am not aware that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3629,any community has a right to force another to be civilised. So long as
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3630,the sufferers by the bad law do not invoke assistance from other
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3631,"communities, I cannot admit that persons entirely unconnected with them"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3632,ought to step in and require that a condition of things with which all
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3633,"who are directly interested appear to be satisfied, should be put an end"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3634,"to because it is a scandal to persons some thousands of miles distant,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3635,"who have no part or concern in it. Let them send missionaries, if they"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3636,"please, to preach against it; and let them, by any fair means (of which"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3637,"silencing the teachers is not one), oppose the progress of similar"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3638,doctrines among their own people. If civilisation has got the better of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3639,"barbarism when barbarism had the world to itself, it is too much to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3640,"profess to be afraid lest barbarism, after having been fairly got under,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3641,should revive and conquer civilisation. A civilisation that can thus
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3642,"succumb to its vanquished enemy, must first have become so degenerate,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3643,"that neither its appointed priests and teachers, nor anybody else, has"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3644,"the capacity, or will take the trouble, to stand up for it. If this be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3645,"so, the sooner such a civilisation receives notice to quit, the better."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3646,"It can only go on from bad to worse, until destroyed and regenerated"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3647,(like the Western Empire) by energetic barbarians.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3648,FOOTNOTE:
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3649,[14] The case of the Bombay Parsees is a curious instance in point. When
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3650,"this industrious and enterprising tribe, the descendants of the Persian"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3651,"fire-worshippers, flying from their native country before the Caliphs,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3652,"arrived in Western India, they were admitted to toleration by the Hindoo"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3653,"sovereigns, on condition of not eating beef. When those regions"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3654,"afterwards fell under the dominion of Mahomedan conquerors, the Parsees"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3655,"obtained from them a continuance of indulgence, on condition of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3656,refraining from pork. What was at first obedience to authority became a
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3657,"second nature, and the Parsees to this day abstain both from beef and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3658,"pork. Though not required by their religion, the double abstinence has"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3659,"had time to grow into a custom of their tribe; and custom, in the East,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,4,3660,is a religion.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3661,CHAPTER V.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3662,APPLICATIONS.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3663,The principles asserted in these pages must be more generally admitted
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3664,"as the basis for discussion of details, before a consistent application"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3665,of them to all the various departments of government and morals can be
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3666,attempted with any prospect of advantage. The few observations I propose
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3667,"to make on questions of detail, are designed to illustrate the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3668,"principles, rather than to follow them out to their consequences. I"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3669,"offer, not so much applications, as specimens of application; which may"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3670,serve to bring into greater clearness the meaning and limits of the two
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3671,"maxims which together form the entire doctrine of this Essay, and to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3672,"assist the judgment in holding the balance between them, in the cases"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3673,where it appears doubtful which of them is applicable to the case.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3674,"The maxims are, first, that the individual is not accountable to society"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3675,"for his actions, in so far as these concern the interests of no person"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3676,"but himself. Advice, instruction, persuasion, and avoidance by other"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3677,"people if thought necessary by them for their own good, are the only"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3678,measures by which society can justifiably express its dislike or
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3679,"disapprobation of his conduct. Secondly, that for such actions as are"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3680,"prejudicial to the interests of others, the individual is accountable"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3681,"and may be subjected either to social or to legal punishments, if"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3682,society is of opinion that the one or the other is requisite for its
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3683,protection.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3684,"In the first place, it must by no means be supposed, because damage, or"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3685,"probability of damage, to the interests of others, can alone justify the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3686,"interference of society, that therefore it always does justify such"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3687,"interference. In many cases, an individual, in pursuing a legitimate"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3688,"object, necessarily and therefore legitimately causes pain or loss to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3689,"others, or intercepts a good which they had a reasonable hope of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3690,obtaining. Such oppositions of interest between individuals often arise
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3691,"from bad social institutions, but are unavoidable while those"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3692,institutions last; and some would be unavoidable under any institutions.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3693,"Whoever succeeds in an overcrowded profession, or in a competitive"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3694,examination; whoever is preferred to another in any contest for an
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3695,"object which both desire, reaps benefit from the loss of others, from"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3696,"their wasted exertion and their disappointment. But it is, by common"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3697,"admission, better for the general interest of mankind, that persons"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3698,should pursue their objects undeterred by this sort of consequences. In
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3699,"other words, society admits no rights, either legal or moral, in the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3700,"disappointed competitors, to immunity from this kind of suffering; and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3701,"feels called on to interfere, only when means of success have been"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3702,"employed which it is contrary to the general interest to permit--namely,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3703,"fraud or treachery, and force."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3704,"Again, trade is a social act. Whoever undertakes to sell any description"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3705,"of goods to the public, does what affects the interest of other persons,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3706,"and of society in general; and thus his conduct, in principle, comes"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3707,"within the jurisdiction of society: accordingly, it was once held to be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3708,"the duty of governments, in all cases which were considered of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3709,"importance, to fix prices, and regulate the processes of manufacture."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3710,"But it is now recognised, though not till after a long struggle, that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3711,both the cheapness and the good quality of commodities are most
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3712,effectually provided for by leaving the producers and sellers perfectly
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3713,"free, under the sole check of equal freedom to the buyers for supplying"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3714,"themselves elsewhere. This is the so-called doctrine of Free Trade,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3715,"which rests on grounds different from, though equally solid with, the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3716,principle of individual liberty asserted in this Essay. Restrictions on
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3717,"trade, or on production for purposes of trade, are indeed restraints;"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3718,"and all restraint, _qua_ restraint, is an evil: but the restraints in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3719,question affect only that part of conduct which society is competent to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3720,"restrain, and are wrong solely because they do not really produce the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3721,results which it is desired to produce by them. As the principle of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3722,"individual liberty is not involved in the doctrine of Free Trade, so"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3723,neither is it in most of the questions which arise respecting the limits
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3724,"of that doctrine: as for example, what amount of public control is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3725,admissible for the prevention of fraud by adulteration; how far sanitary
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3726,"precautions, or arrangements to protect work-people employed in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3727,"dangerous occupations, should be enforced on employers. Such questions"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3728,"involve considerations of liberty, only in so far as leaving people to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3729,"themselves is always better, _caeteris paribus_, than controlling them:"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3730,"but that they may be legitimately controlled for these ends, is in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3731,"principle undeniable. On the other hand, there are questions relating to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3732,"interference with trade, which are essentially questions of liberty;"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3733,"such as the Maine Law, already touched upon; the prohibition of the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3734,importation of opium into China; the restriction of the sale of poisons;
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3735,"all cases, in short, where the object of the interference is to make it"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3736,impossible or difficult to obtain a particular commodity. These
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3737,"interferences are objectionable, not as infringements on the liberty of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3738,"the producer or seller, but on that of the buyer."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3739,"One of these examples, that of the sale of poisons, opens a new"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3740,question; the proper limits of what may be called the functions of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3741,police; how far liberty may legitimately be invaded for the prevention
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3742,"of crime, or of accident. It is one of the undisputed functions of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3743,government to take precautions against crime before it has been
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3744,"committed, as well as to detect and punish it afterwards. The preventive"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3745,"function of government, however, is far more liable to be abused, to the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3746,"prejudice of liberty, than the punitory function; for there is hardly"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3747,any part of the legitimate freedom of action of a human being which
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3748,"would not admit of being represented, and fairly too, as increasing the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3749,"facilities for some form or other of delinquency. Nevertheless, if a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3750,"public authority, or even a private person, sees any one evidently"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3751,"preparing to commit a crime, they are not bound to look on inactive"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3752,"until the crime is committed, but may interfere to prevent it. If"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3753,poisons were never bought or used for any purpose except the commission
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3754,"of murder, it would be right to prohibit their manufacture and sale."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3755,"They may, however, be wanted not only for innocent but for useful"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3756,"purposes, and restrictions cannot be imposed in the one case without"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3757,"operating in the other. Again, it is a proper office of public authority"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3758,to guard against accidents. If either a public officer or any one else
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3759,saw a person attempting to cross a bridge which had been ascertained to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3760,"be unsafe, and there were no time to warn him of his danger, they might"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3761,"seize him and turn him back, without any real infringement of his"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3762,"liberty; for liberty consists in doing what one desires, and he does not"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3763,"desire to fall into the river. Nevertheless, when there is not a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3764,"certainty, but only a danger of mischief, no one but the person himself"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3765,can judge of the sufficiency of the motive which may prompt him to incur
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3766,"the risk: in this case, therefore (unless he is a child, or delirious,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3767,or in some state of excitement or absorption incompatible with the full
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3768,"use of the reflecting faculty), he ought, I conceive, to be only warned"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3769,of the danger; not forcibly prevented from exposing himself to it.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3770,"Similar considerations, applied to such a question as the sale of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3771,"poisons, may enable us to decide which among the possible modes of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3772,"regulation are or are not contrary to principle. Such a precaution, for"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3773,"example, as that of labelling the drug with some word expressive of its"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3774,"dangerous character, may be enforced without violation of liberty: the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3775,buyer cannot wish not to know that the thing he possesses has poisonous
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3776,qualities. But to require in all cases the certificate of a medical
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3777,"practitioner, would make it sometimes impossible, always expensive, to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3778,"obtain the article for legitimate uses. The only mode apparent to me, in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3779,which difficulties may be thrown in the way of crime committed through
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3780,"this means, without any infringement, worth taking into account, upon"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3781,the liberty of those who desire the poisonous substance for other
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3782,"purposes, consists in providing what, in the apt language of Bentham, is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3783,"called ""preappointed evidence."" This provision is familiar to every one"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3784,"in the case of contracts. It is usual and right that the law, when a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3785,"contract is entered into, should require as the condition of its"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3786,"enforcing performance, that certain formalities should be observed, such"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3787,"as signatures, attestation of witnesses, and the like, in order that in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3788,"case of subsequent dispute, there may be evidence to prove that the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3789,"contract was really entered into, and that there was nothing in the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3790,"circumstances to render it legally invalid: the effect being, to throw"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3791,"great obstacles in the way of fictitious contracts, or contracts made in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3792,"circumstances which, if known, would destroy their validity. Precautions"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3793,of a similar nature might be enforced in the sale of articles adapted to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3794,"be instruments of crime. The seller, for example, might be required to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3795,"enter into a register the exact time of the transaction, the name and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3796,"address of the buyer, the precise quality and quantity sold; to ask the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3797,"purpose for which it was wanted, and record the answer he received. When"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3798,"there was no medical prescription, the presence of some third person"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3799,"might be required, to bring home the fact to the purchaser, in case"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3800,there should afterwards be reason to believe that the article had been
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3801,applied to criminal purposes. Such regulations would in general be no
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3802,"material impediment to obtaining the article, but a very considerable"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3803,one to making an improper use of it without detection.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3804,"The right inherent in society, to ward off crimes against itself by"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3805,"antecedent precautions, suggests the obvious limitations to the maxim,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3806,that purely self-regarding misconduct cannot properly be meddled with
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3807,"in the way of prevention or punishment. Drunkenness, for example, in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3808,"ordinary cases, is not a fit subject for legislative interference; but I"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3809,"should deem it perfectly legitimate that a person, who had once been"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3810,"convicted of any act of violence to others under the influence of drink,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3811,"should be placed under a special legal restriction, personal to himself;"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3812,"that if he were afterwards found drunk, he should be liable to a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3813,"penalty, and that if when in that state he committed another offence,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3814,the punishment to which he would be liable for that other offence should
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3815,"be increased in severity. The making himself drunk, in a person whom"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3816,"drunkenness excites to do harm to others, is a crime against others. So,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3817,"again, idleness, except in a person receiving support from the public,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3818,"or except when it constitutes a breach of contract, cannot without"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3819,tyranny be made a subject of legal punishment; but if either from
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3820,"idleness or from any other avoidable cause, a man fails to perform his"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3821,"legal duties to others, as for instance to support his children, it is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3822,"no tyranny to force him to fulfil that obligation, by compulsory labour,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3823,if no other means are available.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3824,"Again, there are many acts which, being directly injurious only to the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3825,"agents themselves, ought not to be legally interdicted, but which, if"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3826,"done publicly, are a violation of good manners and coming thus within"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3827,the category of offences against others may rightfully be prohibited. Of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3828,this kind are offences against decency; on which it is unnecessary to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3829,"dwell, the rather as they are only connected indirectly with our"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3830,"subject, the objection to publicity being equally strong in the case of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3831,"many actions not in themselves condemnable, nor supposed to be so."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3832,"There is another question to which an answer must be found, consistent"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3833,with the principles which have been laid down. In cases of personal
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3834,"conduct supposed to be blamable, but which respect for liberty precludes"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3835,"society from preventing or punishing, because the evil directly"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3836,"resulting falls wholly on the agent; what the agent is free to do, ought"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3837,other persons to be equally free to counsel or instigate? This question
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3838,is not free from difficulty. The case of a person who solicits another
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3839,"to do an act, is not strictly a case of self-regarding conduct. To give"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3840,"advice or offer inducements to any one, is a social act, and may"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3841,"therefore, like actions in general which affect others, be supposed"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3842,amenable to social control. But a little reflection corrects the first
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3843,"impression, by showing that if the case is not strictly within the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3844,"definition of individual liberty, yet the reasons on which the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3845,"principle of individual liberty is grounded, are applicable to it. If"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3846,"people must be allowed, in whatever concerns only themselves, to act as"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3847,"seems best to themselves at their own peril, they must equally be free"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3848,to consult with one another about what is fit to be so done; to exchange
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3849,"opinions, and give and receive suggestions. Whatever it is permitted to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3850,"do, it must be permitted to advise to do. The question is doubtful, only"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3851,when the instigator derives a personal benefit from his advice; when he
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3852,"makes it his occupation, for subsistence or pecuniary gain, to promote"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3853,"what society and the state consider to be an evil. Then, indeed, a new"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3854,"element of complication is introduced; namely, the existence of classes"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3855,of persons with an interest opposed to what is considered as the public
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3856,"weal, and whose mode of living is grounded on the counteraction of it."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3857,"Ought this to be interfered with, or not? Fornication, for example, must"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3858,"be tolerated, and so must gambling; but should a person be free to be a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3859,"pimp, or to keep a gambling-house? The case is one of those which lie on"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3860,"the exact boundary line between two principles, and it is not at once"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3861,apparent to which of the two it properly belongs. There are arguments on
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3862,"both sides. On the side of toleration it may be said, that the fact of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3863,"following anything as an occupation, and living or profiting by the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3864,"practice of it, cannot make that criminal which would otherwise be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3865,admissible; that the act should either be consistently permitted or
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3866,consistently prohibited; that if the principles which we have hitherto
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3867,"defended are true, society has no business, _as_ society, to decide"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3868,anything to be wrong which concerns only the individual; that it cannot
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3869,"go beyond dissuasion, and that one person should be as free to persuade,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3870,"as another to dissuade. In opposition to this it may be contended, that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3871,"although the public, or the State, are not warranted in authoritatively"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3872,"deciding, for purposes of repression or punishment, that such or such"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3873,"conduct affecting only the interests of the individual is good or bad,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3874,"they are fully justified in assuming, if they regard it as bad, that its"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3875,"being so or not is at least a disputable question: That, this being"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3876,"supposed, they cannot be acting wrongly in endeavouring to exclude the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3877,"influence of solicitations which are not disinterested, of instigators"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3878,who cannot possibly be impartial--who have a direct personal interest on
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3879,"one side, and that side the one which the State believes to be wrong,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3880,and who confessedly promote it for personal objects only. There can
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3881,"surely, it may be urged, be nothing lost, no sacrifice of good, by so"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3882,"ordering matters that persons shall make their election, either wisely"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3883,"or foolishly, on their own prompting, as free as possible from the arts"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3884,of persons who stimulate their inclinations for interested purposes of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3885,their own. Thus (it may be said) though the statutes respecting unlawful
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3886,games are utterly indefensible--though all persons should be free to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3887,"gamble in their own or each other's houses, or in any place of meeting"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3888,"established by their own subscriptions, and open only to the members and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3889,their visitors--yet public gambling-houses should not be permitted. It
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3890,"is true that the prohibition is never effectual, and that whatever"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3891,"amount of tyrannical power is given to the police, gambling-houses can"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3892,always be maintained under other pretences; but they may be compelled to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3893,"conduct their operations with a certain degree of secrecy and mystery,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3894,so that nobody knows anything about them but those who seek them; and
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3895,"more than this, society ought not to aim at. There is considerable force"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3896,in these arguments; I will not venture to decide whether they are
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3897,"sufficient to justify the moral anomaly of punishing the accessary, when"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3898,the principal is (and must be) allowed to go free; or fining or
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3899,"imprisoning the procurer, but not the fornicator, the gambling-house"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3900,"keeper, but not the gambler. Still less ought the common operations of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3901,buying and selling to be interfered with on analogous grounds. Almost
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3902,"every article which is bought and sold may be used in excess, and the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3903,sellers have a pecuniary interest in encouraging that excess; but no
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3904,"argument can be founded on this, in favour, for instance, of the Maine"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3905,"Law; because the class of dealers in strong drinks, though interested in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3906,"their abuse, are indispensably required for the sake of their legitimate"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3907,"use. The interest, however, of these dealers in promoting intemperance"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3908,"is a real evil, and justifies the State in imposing restrictions and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3909,"requiring guarantees, which but for that justification would be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3910,infringements of legitimate liberty.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3911,"A further question is, whether the State, while it permits, should"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3912,nevertheless indirectly discourage conduct which it deems contrary to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3913,"the best interests of the agent; whether, for example, it should take"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3914,"measures to render the means of drunkenness more costly, or add to the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3915,"difficulty of procuring them, by limiting the number of the places of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3916,"sale. On this as on most other practical questions, many distinctions"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3917,require to be made. To tax stimulants for the sole purpose of making
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3918,"them more difficult to be obtained, is a measure differing only in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3919,degree from their entire prohibition; and would be justifiable only if
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3920,"that were justifiable. Every increase of cost is a prohibition, to those"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3921,"whose means do not come up to the augmented price; and to those who do,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3922,it is a penalty laid on them for gratifying a particular taste. Their
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3923,"choice of pleasures, and their mode of expending their income, after"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3924,satisfying their legal and moral obligations to the State and to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3925,"individuals, are their own concern, and must rest with their own"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3926,judgment. These considerations may seem at first sight to condemn the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3927,selection of stimulants as special subjects of taxation for purposes of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3928,revenue. But it must be remembered that taxation for fiscal purposes is
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3929,absolutely inevitable; that in most countries it is necessary that a
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3930,"considerable part of that taxation should be indirect; that the State,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3931,"therefore, cannot help imposing penalties, which to some persons may be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3932,"prohibitory, on the use of some articles of consumption. It is hence the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3933,"duty of the State to consider, in the imposition of taxes, what"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3934,"commodities the consumers can best spare; and _a fortiori_, to select in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3935,"preference those of which it deems the use, beyond a very moderate"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3936,"quantity, to be positively injurious. Taxation, therefore, of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3937,"stimulants, up to the point which produces the largest amount of revenue"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3938,(supposing that the State needs all the revenue which it yields) is not
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3939,"only admissible, but to be approved of."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3940,The question of making the sale of these commodities a more or less
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3941,"exclusive privilege, must be answered differently, according to the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3942,purposes to which the restriction is intended to be subservient. All
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3943,"places of public resort require the restraint of a police, and places of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3944,"this kind peculiarly, because offences against society are especially"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3945,"apt to originate there. It is, therefore, fit to confine the power of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3946,selling these commodities (at least for consumption on the spot) to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3947,persons of known or vouched-for respectability of conduct; to make such
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3948,regulations respecting hours of opening and closing as may be requisite
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3949,"for public surveillance, and to withdraw the licence if breaches of the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3950,peace repeatedly take place through the connivance or incapacity of the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3951,"keeper of the house, or if it becomes a rendezvous for concocting and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3952,preparing offences against the law. Any further restriction I do not
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3953,"conceive to be, in principle, justifiable. The limitation in number, for"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3954,"instance, of beer and spirit-houses, for the express purpose of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3955,"rendering them more difficult of access, and diminishing the occasions"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3956,"of temptation, not only exposes all to an inconvenience because there"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3957,"are some by whom the facility would be abused, but is suited only to a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3958,state of society in which the labouring classes are avowedly treated as
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3959,"children or savages, and placed under an education of restraint, to fit"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3960,them for future admission to the privileges of freedom. This is not the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3961,principle on which the labouring classes are professedly governed in any
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3962,free country; and no person who sets due value on freedom will give his
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3963,"adhesion to their being so governed, unless after all efforts have been"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3964,"exhausted to educate them for freedom and govern them as freemen, and it"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3965,has been definitively proved that they can only be governed as children.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3966,The bare statement of the alternative shows the absurdity of supposing
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3967,that such efforts have been made in any case which needs be considered
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3968,here. It is only because the institutions of this country are a mass of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3969,"inconsistencies, that things find admittance into our practice which"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3970,"belong to the system of despotic, or what is called paternal,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3971,"government, while the general freedom of our institutions precludes the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3972,exercise of the amount of control necessary to render the restraint of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3973,any real efficacy as a moral education.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3974,"It was pointed out in an early part of this Essay, that the liberty of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3975,"the individual, in things wherein the individual is alone concerned,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3976,implies a corresponding liberty in any number of individuals to regulate
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3977,"by mutual agreement such things as regard them jointly, and regard no"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3978,"persons but themselves. This question presents no difficulty, so long as"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3979,the will of all the persons implicated remains unaltered; but since that
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3980,"will may change, it is often necessary, even in things in which they"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3981,"alone are concerned, that they should enter into engagements with one"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3982,"another; and when they do, it is fit, as a general rule, that those"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3983,"engagements should be kept. Yet in the laws, probably, of every country,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3984,this general rule has some exceptions. Not only persons are not held to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3985,"engagements which violate the rights of third parties, but it is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3986,sometimes considered a sufficient reason for releasing them from an
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3987,"engagement, that it is injurious to themselves. In this and most other"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3988,"civilised countries, for example, an engagement by which a person should"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3989,"sell himself, or allow himself to be sold, as a slave, would be null and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3990,void; neither enforced by law nor by opinion. The ground for thus
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3991,"limiting his power of voluntarily disposing of his own lot in life, is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3992,"apparent, and is very clearly seen in this extreme case. The reason for"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3993,"not interfering, unless for the sake of others, with a person's"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3994,"voluntary acts, is consideration for his liberty. His voluntary choice"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3995,"is evidence that what he so chooses is desirable, or at the least"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3996,"endurable, to him, and his good is on the whole best provided for by"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3997,allowing him to take his own means of pursuing it. But by selling
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3998,"himself for a slave, he abdicates his liberty; he foregoes any future"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,3999,"use of it, beyond that single act. He therefore defeats, in his own"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4000,"case, the very purpose which is the justification of allowing him to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4001,dispose of himself. He is no longer free; but is thenceforth in a
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4002,"position which has no longer the presumption in its favour, that would"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4003,be afforded by his voluntarily remaining in it. The principle of freedom
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4004,"cannot require that he should be free not to be free. It is not freedom,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4005,"to be allowed to alienate his freedom. These reasons, the force of which"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4006,"is so conspicuous in this peculiar case, are evidently of far wider"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4007,application; yet a limit is everywhere set to them by the necessities of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4008,"life, which continually require, not indeed that we should resign our"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4009,"freedom, but that we should consent to this and the other limitation of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4010,"it. The principle, however, which demands uncontrolled freedom of action"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4011,"in all that concerns only the agents themselves, requires that those who"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4012,"have become bound to one another, in things which concern no third"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4013,"party, should be able to release one another from the engagement: and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4014,"even without such voluntary release, there are perhaps no contracts or"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4015,"engagements, except those that relate to money or money's worth, of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4016,which one can venture to say that there ought to be no liberty whatever
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4017,"of retractation. Baron Wilhelm von Humboldt, in the excellent essay from"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4018,"which I have already quoted, states it as his conviction, that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4019,"engagements which involve personal relations or services, should never"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4020,be legally binding beyond a limited duration of time; and that the most
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4021,"important of these engagements, marriage, having the peculiarity that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4022,its objects are frustrated unless the feelings of both the parties are
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4023,"in harmony with it, should require nothing more than the declared will"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4024,"of either party to dissolve it. This subject is too important, and too"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4025,"complicated, to be discussed in a parenthesis, and I touch on it only so"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4026,far as is necessary for purposes of illustration. If the conciseness and
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4027,generality of Baron Humboldt's dissertation had not obliged him in this
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4028,instance to content himself with enunciating his conclusion without
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4029,"discussing the premises, he would doubtless have recognised that the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4030,question cannot be decided on grounds so simple as those to which he
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4031,"confines himself. When a person, either by express promise or by"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4032,"conduct, has encouraged another to rely upon his continuing to act in a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4033,"certain way--to build expectations and calculations, and stake any part"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4034,"of his plan of life upon that supposition, a new series of moral"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4035,"obligations arises on his part towards that person, which may possibly"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4036,"be overruled, but cannot be ignored. And again, if the relation between"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4037,two contracting parties has been followed by consequences to others; if
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4038,"it has placed third parties in any peculiar position, or, as in the case"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4039,"of marriage, has even called third parties into existence, obligations"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4040,arise on the part of both the contracting parties towards those third
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4041,"persons, the fulfilment of which, or at all events the mode of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4042,"fulfilment, must be greatly affected by the continuance or disruption of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4043,the relation between the original parties to the contract. It does not
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4044,"follow, nor can I admit, that these obligations extend to requiring the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4045,fulfilment of the contract at all costs to the happiness of the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4046,reluctant party; but they are a necessary element in the question; and
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4047,"even if, as Von Humboldt maintains, they ought to make no difference in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4048,the _legal_ freedom of the parties to release themselves from the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4049,engagement (and I also hold that they ought not to make _much_
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4050,"difference), they necessarily make a great difference in the _moral_"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4051,"freedom. A person is bound to take all these circumstances into account,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4052,before resolving on a step which may affect such important interests of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4053,"others; and if he does not allow proper weight to those interests, he is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4054,morally responsible for the wrong. I have made these obvious remarks for
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4055,"the better illustration of the general principle of liberty, and not"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4056,"because they are at all needed on the particular question, which, on the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4057,"contrary, is usually discussed as if the interest of children was"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4058,"everything, and that of grown persons nothing."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4059,"I have already observed that, owing to the absence of any recognised"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4060,"general principles, liberty is often granted where it should be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4061,"withheld, as well as withheld where it should be granted; and one of the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4062,"cases in which, in the modern European world, the sentiment of liberty"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4063,"is the strongest, is a case where, in my view, it is altogether"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4064,misplaced. A person should be free to do as he likes in his own
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4065,concerns; but he ought not to be free to do as he likes in acting for
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4066,"another, under the pretext that the affairs of another are his own"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4067,"affairs. The State, while it respects the liberty of each in what"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4068,"specially regards himself, is bound to maintain a vigilant control over"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4069,his exercise of any power which it allows him to possess over others.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4070,This obligation is almost entirely disregarded in the case of the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4071,"family relations, a case, in its direct influence on human happiness,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4072,more important than all others taken together. The almost despotic power
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4073,of husbands over wives need not be enlarged upon here because nothing
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4074,"more is needed for the complete removal of the evil, than that wives"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4075,"should have the same rights, and should receive the protection of law in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4076,"the same manner, as all other persons; and because, on this subject, the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4077,defenders of established injustice do not avail themselves of the plea
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4078,"of liberty, but stand forth openly as the champions of power. It is in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4079,"the case of children, that misapplied notions of liberty are a real"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4080,obstacle to the fulfilment by the State of its duties. One would almost
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4081,"think that a man's children were supposed to be literally, and not"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4082,"metaphorically, a part of himself, so jealous is opinion of the smallest"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4083,interference of law with his absolute and exclusive control over them;
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4084,more jealous than of almost any interference with his own freedom of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4085,action: so much less do the generality of mankind value liberty than
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4086,"power. Consider, for example, the case of education. Is it not almost a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4087,"self-evident axiom, that the State should require and compel the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4088,"education, up to a certain standard, of every human being who is born"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4089,its citizen? Yet who is there that is not afraid to recognise and
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4090,assert this truth? Hardly any one indeed will deny that it is one of the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4091,"most sacred duties of the parents (or, as law and usage now stand, the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4092,"father), after summoning a human being into the world, to give to that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4093,being an education fitting him to perform his part well in life towards
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4094,others and towards himself. But while this is unanimously declared to be
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4095,"the father's duty, scarcely anybody, in this country, will bear to hear"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4096,of obliging him to perform it. Instead of his being required to make any
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4097,"exertion or sacrifice for securing education to the child, it is left to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4098,his choice to accept it or not when it is provided gratis! It still
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4099,"remains unrecognised, that to bring a child into existence without a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4100,"fair prospect of being able, not only to provide food for its body, but"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4101,"instruction and training for its mind, is a moral crime, both against"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4102,the unfortunate offspring and against society; and that if the parent
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4103,"does not fulfil this obligation, the State ought to see it fulfilled, at"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4104,"the charge, as far as possible, of the parent."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4105,"Were the duty of enforcing universal education once admitted, there"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4106,"would be an end to the difficulties about what the State should teach,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4107,"and how it should teach, which now convert the subject into a mere"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4108,"battle-field for sects and parties, causing the time and labour which"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4109,"should have been spent in educating, to be wasted in quarrelling about"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4110,education. If the government would make up its mind to _require_ for
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4111,"every child a good education, it might save itself the trouble of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4112,_providing_ one. It might leave to parents to obtain the education where
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4113,"and how they pleased, and content itself with helping to pay the school"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4114,"fees of the poorer class of children, and defraying the entire school"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4115,expenses of those who have no one else to pay for them. The objections
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4116,"which are urged with reason against State education, do not apply to the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4117,"enforcement of education by the State, but to the State's taking upon"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4118,itself to direct that education; which is a totally different thing.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4119,That the whole or any large part of the education of the people should
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4120,"be in State hands, I go as far as any one in deprecating. All that has"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4121,"been said of the importance of individuality of character, and diversity"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4122,"in opinions and modes of conduct, involves, as of the same unspeakable"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4123,"importance, diversity of education. A general State education is a mere"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4124,contrivance for moulding people to be exactly like one another; and as
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4125,the mould in which it casts them is that which pleases the predominant
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4126,"power in the government, whether this be a monarch, a priesthood, an"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4127,"aristocracy, or the majority of the existing generation, in proportion"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4128,"as it is efficient and successful, it establishes a despotism over the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4129,"mind, leading by natural tendency to one over the body. An education"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4130,"established and controlled by the State, should only exist, if it exist"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4131,"at all, as one among many competing experiments, carried on for the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4132,"purpose of example and stimulus, to keep the others up to a certain"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4133,"standard of excellence. Unless, indeed, when society in general is in so"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4134,backward a state that it could not or would not provide for itself any
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4135,"proper institutions of education, unless the government undertook the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4136,"task; then, indeed, the government may, as the less of two great evils,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4137,"take upon itself the business of schools and universities, as it may"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4138,"that of joint stock companies, when private enterprise, in a shape"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4139,"fitted for undertaking great works of industry, does not exist in the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4140,"country. But in general, if the country contains a sufficient number of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4141,"persons qualified to provide education under government auspices, the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4142,same persons would be able and willing to give an equally good education
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4143,"on the voluntary principle, under the assurance of remuneration afforded"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4144,"by a law rendering education compulsory, combined with State aid to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4145,those unable to defray the expense.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4146,The instrument for enforcing the law could be no other than public
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4147,"examinations, extending to all children, and beginning at an early age."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4148,"An age might be fixed at which every child must be examined, to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4149,"ascertain if he (or she) is able to read. If a child proves unable, the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4150,"father, unless he has some sufficient ground of excuse, might be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4151,"subjected to a moderate fine, to be worked out, if necessary, by his"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4152,"labour, and the child might be put to school at his expense. Once in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4153,"every year the examination should be renewed, with a gradually extending"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4154,"range of subjects, so as to make the universal acquisition, and what is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4155,"more, retention, of a certain minimum of general knowledge, virtually"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4156,"compulsory. Beyond that minimum, there should be voluntary examinations"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4157,"on all subjects, at which all who come up to a certain standard of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4158,proficiency might claim a certificate. To prevent the State from
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4159,"exercising, through these arrangements, an improper influence over"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4160,"opinion, the knowledge required for passing an examination (beyond the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4161,"merely instrumental parts of knowledge, such as languages and their use)"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4162,"should, even in the higher class of examinations, be confined to facts"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4163,"and positive science exclusively. The examinations on religion,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4164,"politics, or other disputed topics, should not turn on the truth or"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4165,"falsehood of opinions, but on the matter of fact that such and such an"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4166,"opinion is held, on such grounds, by such authors, or schools, or"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4167,"churches. Under this system, the rising generation would be no worse off"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4168,"in regard to all disputed truths, than they are at present; they would"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4169,"be brought up either churchmen or dissenters as they now are, the state"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4170,"merely taking care that they should be instructed churchmen, or"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4171,instructed dissenters. There would be nothing to hinder them from being
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4172,"taught religion, if their parents chose, at the same schools where they"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4173,were taught other things. All attempts by the state to bias the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4174,"conclusions of its citizens on disputed subjects, are evil; but it may"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4175,very properly offer to ascertain and certify that a person possesses the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4176,"knowledge, requisite to make his conclusions, on any given subject,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4177,worth attending to. A student of philosophy would be the better for
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4178,"being able to stand an examination both in Locke and in Kant, whichever"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4179,"of the two he takes up with, or even if with neither: and there is no"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4180,reasonable objection to examining an atheist in the evidences of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4181,"Christianity, provided he is not required to profess a belief in them."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4182,"The examinations, however, in the higher branches of knowledge should, I"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4183,"conceive, be entirely voluntary. It would be giving too dangerous a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4184,"power to governments, were they allowed to exclude any one from"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4185,"professions, even from the profession of teacher, for alleged deficiency"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4186,"of qualifications: and I think, with Wilhelm von Humboldt, that degrees,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4187,"or other public certificates of scientific or professional acquirements,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4188,"should be given to all who present themselves for examination, and stand"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4189,the test; but that such certificates should confer no advantage over
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4190,"competitors, other than the weight which may be attached to their"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4191,testimony by public opinion.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4192,"It is not in the matter of education only, that misplaced notions of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4193,liberty prevent moral obligations on the part of parents from being
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4194,"recognised, and legal obligations from being imposed, where there are"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4195,"the strongest grounds for the former always, and in many cases for the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4196,"latter also. The fact itself, of causing the existence of a human being,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4197,is one of the most responsible actions in the range of human life. To
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4198,undertake this responsibility--to bestow a life which may be either a
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4199,curse or a blessing--unless the being on whom it is to be bestowed will
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4200,"have at least the ordinary chances of a desirable existence, is a crime"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4201,"against that being. And in a country either over-peopled, or threatened"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4202,"with being so, to produce children, beyond a very small number, with"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4203,"the effect of reducing the reward of labour by their competition, is a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4204,serious offence against all who live by the remuneration of their
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4205,"labour. The laws which, in many countries on the Continent, forbid"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4206,marriage unless the parties can show that they have the means of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4207,"supporting a family, do not exceed the legitimate powers of the state:"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4208,and whether such laws be expedient or not (a question mainly dependent
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4209,"on local circumstances and feelings), they are not objectionable as"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4210,violations of liberty. Such laws are interferences of the state to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4211,"prohibit a mischievous act--an act injurious to others, which ought to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4212,"be a subject of reprobation, and social stigma, even when it is not"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4213,deemed expedient to superadd legal punishment. Yet the current ideas of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4214,"liberty, which bend so easily to real infringements of the freedom of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4215,"the individual, in things which concern only himself, would repel the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4216,attempt to put any restraint upon his inclinations when the consequence
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4217,"of their indulgence is a life, or lives, of wretchedness and depravity"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4218,"to the offspring, with manifold evils to those sufficiently within reach"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4219,to be in any way affected by their actions. When we compare the strange
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4220,"respect of mankind for liberty, with their strange want of respect for"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4221,"it, we might imagine that a man had an indispensable right to do harm"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4222,"to others, and no right at all to please himself without giving pain to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4223,any one.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4224,I have reserved for the last place a large class of questions respecting
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4225,"the limits of government interference, which, though closely connected"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4226,"with the subject of this Essay, do not, in strictness, belong to it."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4227,These are cases in which the reasons against interference do not turn
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4228,upon the principle of liberty: the question is not about restraining the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4229,"actions of individuals, but about helping them: it is asked whether the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4230,"government should do, or cause to be done, something for their benefit,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4231,"instead of leaving it to be done by themselves, individually, or in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4232,voluntary combination.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4233,"The objections to government interference, when it is not such as to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4234,"involve infringement of liberty, may be of three kinds."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4235,"The first is, when the thing to be done is likely to be better done by"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4236,"individuals than by the government. Speaking generally, there is no one"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4237,"so fit to conduct any business, or to determine how or by whom it shall"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4238,"be conducted, as those who are personally interested in it. This"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4239,"principle condemns the interferences, once so common, of the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4240,"legislature, or the officers of government, with the ordinary processes"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4241,of industry. But this part of the subject has been sufficiently enlarged
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4242,"upon by political economists, and is not particularly related to the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4243,principles of this Essay.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4244,The second objection is more nearly allied to our subject. In many
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4245,"cases, though individuals may not do the particular thing so well, on"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4246,"the average, as the officers of government, it is nevertheless desirable"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4247,"that it should be done by them, rather than by the government, as a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4248,means to their own mental education--a mode of strengthening their
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4249,"active faculties, exercising their judgment, and giving them a familiar"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4250,knowledge of the subjects with which they are thus left to deal. This is
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4251,"a principal, though not the sole, recommendation of jury trial (in cases"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4252,not political); of free and popular local and municipal institutions; of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4253,the conduct of industrial and philanthropic enterprises by voluntary
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4254,"associations. These are not questions of liberty, and are connected with"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4255,that subject only by remote tendencies; but they are questions of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4256,development. It belongs to a different occasion from the present to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4257,"dwell on these things as parts of national education; as being, in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4258,"truth, the peculiar training of a citizen, the practical part of the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4259,"political education of a free people, taking them out of the narrow"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4260,"circle of personal and family selfishness, and accustoming them to the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4261,"comprehension of joint interests, the management of joint"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4262,"concerns--habituating them to act from public or semi-public motives,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4263,and guide their conduct by aims which unite instead of isolating them
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4264,"from one another. Without these habits and powers, a free constitution"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4265,"can neither be worked nor preserved, as is exemplified by the too-often"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4266,transitory nature of political freedom in countries where it does not
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4267,rest upon a sufficient basis of local liberties. The management of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4268,"purely local business by the localities, and of the great enterprises of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4269,industry by the union of those who voluntarily supply the pecuniary
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4270,"means, is further recommended by all the advantages which have been set"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4271,"forth in this Essay as belonging to individuality of development, and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4272,diversity of modes of action. Government operations tend to be
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4273,"everywhere alike. With individuals and voluntary associations, on the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4274,"contrary, there are varied experiments, and endless diversity of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4275,"experience. What the State can usefully do, is to make itself a central"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4276,"depository, and active circulator and diffuser, of the experience"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4277,resulting from many trials. Its business is to enable each
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4278,"experimentalist to benefit by the experiments of others, instead of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4279,tolerating no experiments but its own.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4280,"The third, and most cogent reason for restricting the interference of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4281,"government, is the great evil of adding unnecessarily to its power."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4282,"Every function superadded to those already exercised by the government,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4283,"causes its influence over hopes and fears to be more widely diffused,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4284,"and converts, more and more, the active and ambitious part of the public"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4285,"into hangers-on of the government, or of some party which aims at"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4286,"becoming the government. If the roads, the railways, the banks, the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4287,"insurance offices, the great joint-stock companies, the universities,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4288,"and the public charities, were all of them branches of the government;"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4289,"if, in addition, the municipal corporations and local boards, with all"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4290,"that now devolves on them, became departments of the central"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4291,administration; if the employes of all these different enterprises were
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4292,"appointed and paid by the government, and looked to the government for"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4293,every rise in life; not all the freedom of the press and popular
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4294,constitution of the legislature would make this or any other country
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4295,"free otherwise than in name. And the evil would be greater, the more"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4296,efficiently and scientifically the administrative machinery was
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4297,constructed--the more skilful the arrangements for obtaining the best
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4298,qualified hands and heads with which to work it. In England it has of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4299,late been proposed that all the members of the civil service of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4300,"government should be selected by competitive examination, to obtain for"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4301,those employments the most intelligent and instructed persons
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4302,procurable; and much has been said and written for and against this
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4303,"proposal. One of the arguments most insisted on by its opponents, is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4304,that the occupation of a permanent official servant of the State does
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4305,not hold out sufficient prospects of emolument and importance to attract
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4306,"the highest talents, which will always be able to find a more inviting"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4307,"career in the professions, or in the service of companies and other"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4308,public bodies. One would not have been surprised if this argument had
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4309,"been used by the friends of the proposition, as an answer to its"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4310,principal difficulty. Coming from the opponents it is strange enough.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4311,What is urged as an objection is the safety-valve of the proposed
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4312,system. If indeed all the high talent of the country _could_ be drawn
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4313,"into the service of the government, a proposal tending to bring about"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4314,that result might well inspire uneasiness. If every part of the business
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4315,"of society which required organised concert, or large and comprehensive"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4316,"views, were in the hands of the government, and if government offices"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4317,"were universally filled by the ablest men, all the enlarged culture and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4318,"practised intelligence in the country, except the purely speculative,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4319,"would be concentrated in a numerous bureaucracy, to whom alone the rest"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4320,of the community would look for all things: the multitude for direction
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4321,and dictation in all they had to do; the able and aspiring for personal
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4322,"advancement. To be admitted into the ranks of this bureaucracy, and when"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4323,"admitted, to rise therein, would be the sole objects of ambition. Under"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4324,"this regime, not only is the outside public ill-qualified, for want of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4325,"practical experience, to criticise or check the mode of operation of the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4326,"bureaucracy, but even if the accidents of despotic or the natural"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4327,working of popular institutions occasionally raise to the summit a ruler
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4328,"or rulers of reforming inclinations, no reform can be effected which is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4329,contrary to the interest of the bureaucracy. Such is the melancholy
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4330,"condition of the Russian empire, as is shown in the accounts of those"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4331,who have had sufficient opportunity of observation. The Czar himself is
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4332,powerless against the bureaucratic body; he can send any one of them to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4333,"Siberia, but he cannot govern without them, or against their will. On"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4334,"every decree of his they have a tacit veto, by merely refraining from"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4335,carrying it into effect. In countries of more advanced civilisation and
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4336,"of a more insurrectionary spirit, the public, accustomed to expect"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4337,"everything to be done for them by the State, or at least to do nothing"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4338,"for themselves without asking from the State not only leave to do it,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4339,"but even how it is to be done, naturally hold the State responsible for"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4340,"all evil which befalls them, and when the evil exceeds their amount of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4341,"patience, they rise against the government and make what is called a"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4342,"revolution; whereupon somebody else, with or without legitimate"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4343,"authority from the nation, vaults into the seat, issues his orders to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4344,"the bureaucracy, and everything goes on much as it did before; the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4345,"bureaucracy being unchanged, and nobody else being capable of taking"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4346,their place.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4347,A very different spectacle is exhibited among a people accustomed to
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4348,"transact their own business. In France, a large part of the people"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4349,"having been engaged in military service, many of whom have held at least"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4350,"the rank of non-commissioned officers, there are in every popular"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4351,"insurrection several persons competent to take the lead, and improvise"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4352,"some tolerable plan of action. What the French are in military affairs,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4353,the Americans are in every kind of civil business; let them be left
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4354,"without a government, every body of Americans is able to improvise one,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4355,and to carry on that or any other public business with a sufficient
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4356,"amount of intelligence, order, and decision. This is what every free"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4357,people ought to be: and a people capable of this is certain to be free;
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4358,it will never let itself be enslaved by any man or body of men because
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4359,these are able to seize and pull the reins of the central
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4360,administration. No bureaucracy can hope to make such a people as this do
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4361,or undergo anything that they do not like. But where everything is done
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4362,"through the bureaucracy, nothing to which the bureaucracy is really"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4363,adverse can be done at all. The constitution of such countries is an
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4364,"organisation of the experience and practical ability of the nation, into"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4365,a disciplined body for the purpose of governing the rest; and the more
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4366,"perfect that organisation is in itself, the more successful in drawing"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4367,to itself and educating for itself the persons of greatest capacity from
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4368,"all ranks of the community, the more complete is the bondage of all, the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4369,members of the bureaucracy included. For the governors are as much the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4370,"slaves of their organisation and discipline, as the governed are of the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4371,governors. A Chinese mandarin is as much the tool and creature of a
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4372,despotism as the humblest cultivator. An individual Jesuit is to the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4373,"utmost degree of abasement the slave of his order, though the order"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4374,itself exists for the collective power and importance of its members.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4375,"It is not, also, to be forgotten, that the absorption of all the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4376,"principal ability of the country into the governing body is fatal,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4377,"sooner or later, to the mental activity and progressiveness of the body"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4378,"itself. Banded together as they are--working a system which, like all"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4379,"systems, necessarily proceeds in a great measure by fixed rules--the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4380,official body are under the constant temptation of sinking into indolent
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4381,"routine, or, if they now and then desert that mill-horse round, of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4382,rushing into some half-examined crudity which has struck the fancy of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4383,some leading member of the corps: and the sole check to these closely
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4384,"allied, though seemingly opposite, tendencies, the only stimulus which"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4385,"can keep the ability of the body itself up to a high standard, is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4386,liability to the watchful criticism of equal ability outside the body.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4387,"It is indispensable, therefore, that the means should exist,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4388,"independently of the government, of forming such ability, and furnishing"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4389,it with the opportunities and experience necessary for a correct
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4390,judgment of great practical affairs. If we would possess permanently a
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4391,"skilful and efficient body of functionaries--above all, a body able to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4392,originate and willing to adopt improvements; if we would not have our
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4393,"bureaucracy degenerate into a pedantocracy, this body must not engross"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4394,all the occupations which form and cultivate the faculties required for
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4395,the government of mankind.
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4396,"To determine the point at which evils, so formidable to human freedom"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4397,"and advancement, begin, or rather at which they begin to predominate"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4398,over the benefits attending the collective application of the force of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4399,"society, under its recognised chiefs, for the removal of the obstacles"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4400,which stand in the way of its well-being; to secure as much of the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4401,"advantages of centralised power and intelligence, as can be had without"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4402,turning into governmental channels too great a proportion of the general
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4403,"activity, is one of the most difficult and complicated questions in the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4404,"art of government. It is, in a great measure, a question of detail, in"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4405,"which many and various considerations must be kept in view, and no"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4406,absolute rule can be laid down. But I believe that the practical
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4407,"principle in which safety resides, the ideal to be kept in view, the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4408,standard by which to test all arrangements intended for overcoming the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4409,"difficulty, may be conveyed in these words: the greatest dissemination"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4410,of power consistent with efficiency; but the greatest possible
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4411,"centralisation of information, and diffusion of it from the centre."
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4412,"Thus, in municipal administration, there would be, as in the New England"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4413,"States, a very minute division among separate officers, chosen by the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4414,"localities, of all business which is not better left to the persons"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4415,"directly interested; but besides this, there would be, in each"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4416,"department of local affairs, a central superintendence, forming a branch"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4417,of the general government. The organ of this superintendence would
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4418,"concentrate, as in a focus, the variety of information and experience"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4419,derived from the conduct of that branch of public business in all the
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4420,"localities, from everything analogous which is done in foreign"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4421,"countries, and from the general principles of political science. This"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4422,"central organ should have a right to know all that is done, and its"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4423,special duty should be that of making the knowledge acquired in one
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4424,place available for others. Emancipated from the petty prejudices and
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4425,narrow views of a locality by its elevated position and comprehensive
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4426,"sphere of observation, its advice would naturally carry much authority;"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4427,"but its actual power, as a permanent institution, should, I conceive, be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4428,limited to compelling the local officers to obey the laws laid down for
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4429,"their guidance. In all things not provided for by general rules, those"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4430,"officers should be left to their own judgment, under responsibility to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4431,"their constituents. For the violation of rules, they should be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4432,"responsible to law, and the rules themselves should be laid down by the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4433,legislature; the central administrative authority only watching over
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4434,"their execution, and if they were not properly carried into effect,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4435,"appealing, according to the nature of the case, to the tribunal to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4436,"enforce the law, or to the constituencies to dismiss the functionaries"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4437,"who had not executed it according to its spirit. Such, in its general"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4438,"conception, is the central superintendence which the Poor Law Board is"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4439,intended to exercise over the administrators of the Poor Rate throughout
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4440,"the country. Whatever powers the Board exercises beyond this limit, were"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4441,"right and necessary in that peculiar case, for the cure of rooted habits"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4442,of maladministration in matters deeply affecting not the localities
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4443,"merely, but the whole community; since no locality has a moral right to"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4444,"make itself by mismanagement a nest of pauperism, necessarily"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4445,"overflowing into other localities, and impairing the moral and physical"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4446,condition of the whole labouring community. The powers of administrative
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4447,coercion and subordinate legislation possessed by the Poor Law Board
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4448,"(but which, owing to the state of opinion on the subject, are very"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4449,"scantily exercised by them), though perfectly justifiable in a case of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4450,"first-rate national interest, would be wholly out of place in the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4451,superintendence of interests purely local. But a central organ of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4452,"information and instruction for all the localities, would be equally"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4453,valuable in all departments of administration. A government cannot have
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4454,"too much of the kind of activity which does not impede, but aids and"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4455,"stimulates, individual exertion and development. The mischief begins"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4456,"when, instead of calling forth the activity and powers of individuals"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4457,"and bodies, it substitutes its own activity for theirs; when, instead of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4458,"informing, advising, and, upon occasion, denouncing, it makes them work"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4459,"in fetters, or bids them stand aside and does their work instead of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4460,"them. The worth of a State, in the long run, is the worth of the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4461,individuals composing it; and a State which postpones the interests of
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4462,"_their_ mental expansion and elevation, to a little more of"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4463,"administrative skill, or of that semblance of it which practice gives,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4464,"in the details of business; a State which dwarfs its men, in order that"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4465,they may be more docile instruments in its hands even for beneficial
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4466,"purposes, will find that with small men no great thing can really be"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4467,accomplished; and that the perfection of machinery to which it has
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4468,"sacrificed everything, will in the end avail it nothing, for want of the"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4469,"vital power which, in order that the machine might work more smoothly,"
John Stuart Mill,On Liberty,34901,5,4470,it has preferred to banish.
