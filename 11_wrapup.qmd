## Project management

### RStudio projects

-   RStudio projects are an excellent way to keep all the files associated with a project (data, R scripts, results, figures, etc.) in one place on your computer.

-   This is one of the best ways to improve your workflow in RStudio, allowing you to:

    -   Create a project for each paper or data analysis project.
    -   Store data files in one place.
    -   Save, edit, and run scripts.
    -   Keep outputs such as plots and cleaned data.

-   To create a new project file, click `File > New Project`, then:

    ![](images/new_project_step1.png){fig-align="center" width="400"}

    ![](images/new_project_step2.png){fig-align="center" width="400"}

    ![](images/new_project_step3.png){fig-align="center" width="400"}

-   Call your project some version of "methodscamptest" and choose carefully where you wish to store the project on your machine.

::: callout-warning
If you don't store your project (and your other files, too!) somewhere reasonable, it will be hard to find it in the future! We recommend creating a clear organizational scheme for yourself early on.

#### Using RStudio projects

When using an RStudio project, you should see its name in the top-right corner of RStudio, next to a light blue icon. You can check with R the folder in which your project operates:

```{r}
#| eval: false
getwd()
```

-   Now, as an example, let's run the following commands in the script editor and save the files into the project directory.

```{r}
#| eval: false

library(tidyverse)

my_plot <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) + 
  geom_point()

ggsave(plot = my_plot,
       filename = "plot_mtcars.pdf")

write_csv(mtcars, "mtcars.csv")
```

-   Quit RStudio and check out the folder associated with the project.

-   You should see the PDF file for the plot, the .csv file for the data, and the `.Rproj` file for the project itself.

-   Double-click the `.Rproj` file to reopen the project and pick up where you left off! Everything you need should be ready to go.

## Quarto documents and R Scripts

We have worked with .qmd scripts during Methods Camp. [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is a very flexible format that allows code, math, and text. People use it to make reports (PDF or HTML), presentations, websites, etc. You can create a Quarto document from RStudio using `File > New File > Quarto Document`, and then compile it to its final form using the "Render" button.

You should also be aware of regular R scripts, with a .R extension. They can be created in RStudio using `File > New File > R Script`. They just allow code: to add comments, you need to preface them by the pound sign (`#`).

## Other software resources

### Overleaf

::: {style="float: right; position: relative; top: 0px; padding: 30px;"}
![](images/overleaf.png){width="250"}
:::

-   [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) is a collaborative cloud-based LaTeX editor designed for writing, editing, and publishing documents.

    -   LaTeX is a software used for typesetting technical documents. It is used widely in our discipline for the preparation for manuscripts to journals and other publishing venues.

-   UT Austin actually provides free access to Overleaf Professional to graduate students using your UT email. (The Professional accounts allows more collaborators on projects and other goodies.)

## Exercise

Create an Overleaf Professional account using your UT email address. You can do so [here](https://www.overleaf.com/edu/utexas).

$$
\hat{\beta} = (X'X)^{-1}X'Y
$$

LaTeX is actually the markup language that the math in Quarto and this website! If you are curious about general syntax and commands, you can access [our repository](https://github.com/methodscamp/methodscamp.github.io) at any time to get a closer look.

### Zotero

::: {style="float: right; position: relative; top: 0px; padding: 30px;"}
![](images/zotero_512x512x32.png){width="200"}
:::

-   Zotero is an open-source reference manager used to store, manage, and cite bibliographic references, such as books and articles.

-   When it is time to write, you can insert your sources directly into your paper as in-text citations via a word processor plugin, which generates a bibliography in your style of choice (e.g., APA). It works with Word, Google Docs, Overleaf, and RStudio.

    -   This can save a lot of time, especially when you have to change citation styles for submission to another journal.

-   You can download the software for free [here](https://www.zotero.org/).

::: callout-note
Zotero is one of many other reference managers out there. Alternatives include Mendeley and EndNote, among others. You should choose whatever option best suits your needs.
