# R and RStudio

## Installing R and RStudio

[R](https://cran.r-project.org/) is a programming language optimized for statistics and data analysis. Most people use R from [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/), a graphical user interface (GUI) that includes a file pane, a graphics pane, and other goodies. Both R and RStudio are open source, i.e., free as in beer and free as in freedom!

Your first steps should be to install R and RStudio, in that order (if you have installed these programs before, make sure that your versions are up-to-date---if not, follow the instructions below):

1. Download and install R from [the official website, CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). Click on "Download R for \<Windows/Mac\>" and follow the instructions. If you have a Mac, make sure to select the version appropriate for your system (Apple Silicon for newer M1/M2 Macs and Intel for older Macs).

2. Download and install RStudio from [the official website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). Scroll down and select the installer for your operating system.

After these two steps, you can open RStudio in your system, as you would with any program. You should see something like this:

That's it for the installation! We also *strongly* recommend that you change a couple of RStudio's default settings:[^settings]

- `Tools > Global Options > General > Uncheck "Restore .RData into workspace at startup"`

- `Tools > Global Options > General > Save workspace to .RData on Exit > Select "Never"`

- `Tools > Appearance` to change to a dark theme, if you want! Pros: better for night sessions, hacker vibes...

[^settings]: The idea behind these settings is to force R to start from scratch with each new session. No lingering objects avoids misunderstandings and helps with reproducibility!
