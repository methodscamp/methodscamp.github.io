    "text": "Description\nWelcome to Introduction to Methods for Political Science, aka “Methods Camp”! In the past our incoming students have told us their math skills are rusty and they would like to be better prepared for UT’s methods courses. Methods Camp is designed to give everyone a chance to brush up on some skills in preparation for the Stats I and Formal Theory I courses. The other goal of Methods Camp is to allow you to get to know your cohort. We hope that struggling with matrix algebra and the dreaded chain rule will still prove to be a good bonding exercise.\nAs you can see from the above schedule, we’ll be meeting on Friday, August 11th as well as from Monday, August 14th through Thursday, August 17th. Classes at UT begin the start of the following week on Monday, August 22nd. Below is a tentaive schedule outlining what will be covered in the class, although we may rearrange things a bit if we find we’re going too slowly or too quickly through any of the material."
