    "text": "Description\nWelcome to Introduction to Methods for Political Science, aka “Methods Camp”! In the past our incoming students have told us their math skills are rusty and they would like to be better prepared for UT’s methods courses. Methods Camp is designed to give everyone a chance to brush up on some skills in preparation for the Stats I and Formal Theory I courses. The other goal of Methods Camp is to allow you to get to know your cohort. We hope that struggling with matrix algebra and the dreaded chain rule will still prove to be a good bonding exercise.\nAs you can see from the above schedule, we’ll be meeting on Friday, August 11th as well as from Monday, August 14th through Thursday, August 17th. Classes at UT begin the start of the following week on Monday, August 22nd. Below is a tentaive schedule outlining what will be covered in the class, although we may rearrange things a bit if we find we’re going too slowly or too quickly through any of the material."

    "text": "6.1 Theory\n\nCalculus is about dealing with infinitesimal values.\nWe are going to focus on two big ideas:\n\nDerivatives\nIntegrals\n\n\n\n6.1.1 Derviative\n\n“Derivative” is just a fancy term for slope.\nSlope is the rate of change \\(\\frac{\\delta y}{\\delta x}\\) or \\(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\).\nSpecifically, the derivative is the instantaneous rate of change.\nWe need slope for our statistics, which are all about fitting lines.\nWe also need slope for taking maxima and minima.\nThe equation for a line is \\(y = mx + b\\). What is its slope?\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Calculating derivatives\n\nSlope is rise over run, which is \\(\\dfrac{f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)}{\\Delta x}\\)\nTo see why, consider the slope of a line connecting two points: \\[m = \\displaystyle\\frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2-x_1}\\]\nWe can define \\(x_2 = x_1 + \\Delta x\\) (or equivalently \\(\\Delta x = x_2 - x_1\\)) \\[m = \\dfrac{f(x_1+ \\Delta x) - f(x_1)}{\\Delta x}\\]\n\n\n\nAs we’ve seen, for a curve, we need to be infinitely close for our line’s defining points, yielding \\[\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0} \\frac{f(x+ \\Delta x)-f(x)}{\\Delta x}\\]\nThis gives us this instantaneous slope (rate of change) of a function at every point on its domain. The above equation is the definition of the derivative.\n\n\n\n6.1.3 Notation\n\n\\(\\frac{d}{dx} f(x)\\) is read “The derivative of \\(f\\) of \\(x\\) with respect to \\(x\\).” - You can also say “The instantaneous rate of change in \\(f\\) of \\(x\\) with respect to \\(x\\).”\nIf \\(y=f(x)\\), \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\) is “The derivative of \\(y\\) with respect to \\(x\\)”. - Warning: Do not try to cancel out the \\(d\\)’s, no matter how tempting it is.\nThere is the advantage of always specifying the variable with respect to which we’re differentiating (it’s the one in the denominator).\n\n\nLagrange’s prime notation: - \\(f'(x)\\) (read: “\\(f\\) prime \\(x\\)”) is the derivative of \\(f(x)\\). - This is useful when it is clear which variable were are referring to (e.g., when there’s only one).\n\n\nWhat is \\(\\dfrac{d(x^2)}{dx}\\)? - \\(x^2\\) - \\(2 x^{2-1}\\) -\\(2x\\)\nWhat is \\(\\frac{d(4x^3)}{dx}\\)?\n\n\\(4x^3\\)\n\\(4*3 x^{3-1}\\)\n\\(12x^2\\)\n\n\n\nPractice\nTake the derivative of each of these. \\[x^3\\] \\[3x^2\\] \\[60x^{11}\\] \\[x\\] \\[\\frac{4}{x^2} \\] \\[9 \\sqrt{x}\\] \\[6 x^{5/2}\\] \\[11,596,232\\]\n\nEvaluate the derivatives at \\(x=2\\) and \\(x=-1\\) \\[x^3\\] \\[3x^2\\] \\[60x^{11}\\] \\[x\\] \\[\\frac{4}{x^2} \\] \\[9 \\sqrt{x}\\] \\[6 x^{5/2}\\] \\[11,596,232\\]\n\nPractice\nTake the derivative of each of these. \\[x^3\\] \\[3x^2\\] \\[60x^{11}\\] \\[x\\] \\[\\frac{4}{x^2} \\] \\[9 \\sqrt{x}\\] \\[6 x^{5/2}\\] \\[11,596,232\\]\n\nEvaluate the derivatives at \\(x=2\\) and \\(x=-1\\) \\[x^3\\] \\[3x^2\\] \\[60x^{11}\\] \\[x\\] \\[\\frac{4}{x^2} \\] \\[9 \\sqrt{x}\\] \\[6 x^{5/2}\\] \\[11,596,232\\]\n\n\n\n6.1.4 Special functions\nA few functions have particular rules:\n\n\\(\\frac{d (ln(x))}{dx}=\\frac{1}{x}\\)\n\\(\\dfrac{d (log_b(x))}{dx}=\\dfrac{1}{x*ln(b)}\\)\n\\(\\frac{d (e^x)}{dx}=e^x\\)\n\\(\\frac{d (a^x)}{dx}=a^x ln(a)\\)\n\\(\\frac{dy}{dx}c=0\\)\n\\(\\frac{d (x^x)}{dx}=x^x (1+ln(x))\\)\n\n\n\n6.1.5 Derivatives with addition and substraction\n\nEasiest rule to remember: \\[\\frac{d (f(x) \\pm g(x))}{dx}=f'(x) \\pm g'(x)\\]\n\n\nPractice\nTake the derivative of each of these \\[x^2 + x +5\\] \\[x^4 - 4x^3 + 5x^2 + 8x - 6\\] \\[3x^5 - 6x^2\\] \\[5x^2 + 8 \\sqrt{x} - \\frac{1}{x}\\] \\[ln(x) + 5e^x - 4x^3\\]"
