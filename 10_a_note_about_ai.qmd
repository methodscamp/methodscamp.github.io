# A Note about AI 




::: callout-warning
### Consume AI wisely! 

* GPT can help with programming, but you must have [domain knowledge](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/yj73GIEKmLI).
* Interactions with ChatGPT are not exactly repeatable.
* GPT can help with expediting search from Google or Stack Overflow for troubleshooting, but it is not always correct.
* Read GPTâ€™s explanation carefully to make sure it does what you want. It is a tool to help you learn, not to do the work for you!
* **Try to type out the generated code yourself, do NOT copy and paste**
* In your problem sets, always acknowledge that you have consulted AI for support.  
* When errors occur, copy the error messages and paste them to GPT for troubleshooting.
* You can continue with follow-up instructions to improve the results.
* In case of a catch-22 situation, use your domain expertise.
