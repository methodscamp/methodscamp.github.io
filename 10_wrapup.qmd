# Wrap-up

## Project management

### RStudio projects

-   RStudio projects are an excellent way to keep all the files associated with a project (data, R scripts, results, figures, etc.) in one place on your computer.

-   This is one of the best ways to improve your workflow in RStudio, allowing you to:

    -   Create a project for each paper or data analysis project.
    -   Store data files in one place.
    -   Save, edit, and run scripts.
    -   Keep outputs such as plots and cleaned data.

-   To create a new project file, click `File > New Project`, then:

    ![](images/new_project_step1.png){fig-align="center" width="400"}

    ![](images/new_project_step2.png){fig-align="center" width="400"}

    ![](images/new_project_step3.png){fig-align="center" width="400"}

-   Call your project some version of "methodscamptest" and choose carefully where you wish to store the project on your machine.

::: callout-warning
If you don't store your project (and your other files, too!) somewhere reasonable, it will be hard to find it in the future! We recommend creating a clear organizational scheme for yourself early on.

#### Using RStudio projects

When using an RStudio project, you should see its name in the top-right corner of RStudio, next to a light blue icon. You can check with R the folder in which your project operates:

```{r}
#| eval: false
getwd()
```

-   Now, as an example, let's run the following commands in the script editor and save the files into the project directory.

```{r}
#| eval: false

library(tidyverse)

my_plot <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) + 
  geom_point()

ggsave(plot = my_plot,
       filename = "plot_mtcars.pdf")

write_csv(mtcars, "mtcars.csv")
```

-   Quit RStudio and check out the folder associated with the project.

-   You should see the PDF file for the plot, the .csv file for the data, and the `.Rproj` file for the project itself.

-   Double-click the `.Rproj` file to reopen the project and pick up where you left off! Everything you need should be ready to go.

### Zotero

:::

-   Zotero is an open-source reference manager used to store, manage, and cite bibliographic references, such as books and articles.

-   When it is time to write, you can insert your sources directly into your paper as in-text citations via a word processor plugin, which generates a bibliography in your style of choice.

    -   This can save a lot of time, especially when you have to change citation styles for submission to another journal.

-   You can download the software for free [here](https://www.zotero.org/).

    -   You can also find a guide on how to install it [here](https://www.zotero.org/support/installation).

::: callout-note
Zotero is one of many other reference managers out there. Alternatives include Mendeley and EndNote, among others. You should choose whatever option best suits your needs.

    -   Full compatibility with Google Docs
    -   Free plugin for Word and LibreOffice included
    -   Includes most popular citation styles with more styles available on the [Zotero Style Repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles)
    -   Drag and drop PDF files into the library, extracting metadata such as authors, year, etc.
    -   Allows advanced searches of all content in your library using full-text PDF indexing
    -   Use cloud storage (optional) and sync libraries across devices
    -   Create unlimited private or public groups and collaborate by sharing files and citations
    -   300MB of free cloud storage and 2GB of storage for \$20 USD/year (equal to \$1.67 per month)
