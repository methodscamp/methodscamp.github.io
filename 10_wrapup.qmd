-   Zotero is an open-source reference manager used to store, manage, and cite bibliographic references, such as books and articles.

-   When it is time to write, you can insert your sources directly into your paper as in-text citations via a word processor plugin, which generates a bibliography in your style of choice.

    -   This can save a lot of time, especially when you have to change citation styles for submission to another journal.

-   You can download the software for free [here](https://www.zotero.org/).

    -   You can also find a guide on how to install it [here](https://www.zotero.org/support/installation).

::: callout-note
Zotero is one of many other reference managers out there. Alternatives include Mendeley and EndNote, among others. You should choose whatever option best suits your needs.
