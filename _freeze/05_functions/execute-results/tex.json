Why not?\n\n![](images/function_notfunction.jpg)\n\n## Types of functions\n\n### Linear functions\n\n-   We can easily make a function that describes a line.\n\n$$y=mx+b$$ - $m$ is the slope (for every one unit increase in $x$, $y$ increases $m$ units). \n\n- $b$ is the y-intercept: the value of $y$ when $x=0$.\n\n- More generally, $y=a+bx$ - $a$ is the intercept and $b$ is the slope.\n\n### Quadratic\n\n-   These lines have one curve. $$y=ax^2 + bx + c$$\n-   $a$, $b$, and $c$ don't have well-defined meanings here.\n-   If $a$ is negative, the function opens downward; if $a$ is positive,it opens upward.\n-   Note that $x^2$ always returns positive values.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05_functions_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-1-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Cubic\n\n-   These lines (generally) have two curves (inflection points).\n-   $y=ax^3 + bx^2 + cx +d$\n-   $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ don't have well-defined meanings here.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05_functions_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Polynomial\n\n$$y=ax^n + bx^{n-1} + ... + c$$ \n- These functions have (maximum) $n-1$ changes in direction (turning points). \n- They also have (maximum) $n$ x-intercepts. \n- They can be made arbitrarily precise.\n\n### Exponential\n\n$$y = ab^{x}$$ or $$f(x)=ab^x$$\n\n-   Here our independent variable, or input ($x$), is the exponent.\n\n### Trigonometric functions\n\n-   These functions include sine, cosine, and tangent.\n-   They are interesting (to some), but not usually useful for social science.\n\n## Logarithms and exponents\n\n### Logarithms\n\n-   Logarithms are basically the opposite (inverse) of exponents.\n-   They ask how many times you must raise the base to get $x$.\n-   $log_a(b)=x$ is asking \"a raised to what power x gives b?\n-   $\\log_3(81) = 4$ because $3^4=81$\n-   Logarithms can be undefined.\n-   The base cannot be 0, 1, or negative.\n\n### Relationships\n\nIf, $$ log_ax=b$$ then, $$a^{log_{a}x}=a^b$$ and $$x=a^b$$\n\n### Basic rules\n\n$$\\dfrac{\\log_x n}{\\log_x m} = \\log_m n$$\n\n$$\\log_x(ab) = \\log_xa + \\log_xb $$\n\n$$\\log_x\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right) = \\log_xa - \\log_xb$$\n\n$$\\log_xa^b = b \\log_x a$$\n\n$$\\log_x 1 = 0$$\n\n$$log_{x}x=1$$\n\n$$m^{\\log_m(a)} = a$$ \n\n### Natural logarithms\n\n-   We most often use natural logarithms.\n-   This means log$_e(x)$, often written ln$(x)$.\n-   $e \\approx 2.7183$.\n-   ln(x) and its exponent opposite, $e^x$, have nice properties when we hit calculus.\n\n### Definition of e\n\n-   Imagine you invest \\$1 in a bank and receive 100% interest for one year, and the bank pays you back once a year: $$(1+1)^1= 2$$\n-   When it pays you twice a year with compound interest:\n\n$$(1+1/2)^2=2.25$$\n\n-   If it pays you three times a year:\n\n$$(1+1/3)^3=2.37...$$\n\n-   What will happen when the bank pays you once a month? Once a day?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n$$(1+\\frac{1}{n})^{n}$$\n\n-   However, there is limit to what you can get\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (1 + \\dfrac{1}{n})^n = 2.7183... = e$$\n\n-   For any interest rate $k$ and number of times the bank pays you $t$: $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (1 + \\dfrac{k}{n})^{nt} = e^{kt}$$\n-   $e$ is important for defining *exponential growth*. Since $ln(e^x) = x$, the natural logarithm helps us turn exponential functions into linear ones.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Practice**\n\nSolve the problems below, simplifying as much as you can. $$log_{10}(1000)$$ $$log_2(\\dfrac{8}{32})$$ $$10^{log_{10}(300)}$$ $$ln(1)$$ $$ln(e^2)$$ $$ln(5e)$$\n\n## Functions of functions\n\n### Basics\n\n-   Functions can take other functions as arguments.\n\n-   This means that outside function takes output of inside function as its input.\n\n-   This is typically written as $f(g(x))$.\n\n-   Say we have the exterior function f(x)=$x^2$ and the interior function g(x)=$x-3$.\n\n-   Then if we want f(g(x)), we would subtract 3 from any input, and then square the result.\n\n-   We write this $(x-3)^2$, NOT $x^2-3$.\n\n### PMF, PDF, and CDF\n\n-   PMF - probability mass function\n    -   This gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value.\n-   PDF - probability density function\n    -   This gives the probability that a continuous random variable falls within a particular range of values.\n-   CDF - cumulative distribution function\n    -   This gives the probability that a random variable X takes a value less than or equal to $x$.\n",
