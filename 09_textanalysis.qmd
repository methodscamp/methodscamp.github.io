# Text analysis

## Strings

-   In R, a piece of text is represented as a sequence of characters (letters, numbers, and symbols).

-   A string is a sequence of characters, which is used for storing text.

    -   For example, "methods" is a string that includes characters: m, e, t, h, o, d, s.

-   Creating strings is very straightforward in RStudio. We assign character values to a variable, being sure to enclose the character values (the text) in double or single quotation marks.

    -   We can create strings of single words, or whole sentences if we so wish.

```{r}
string1 <- "camp" 
string1

string2 <- "I love methods camps."
string2
```

-   We can also create a vector of strings.

```{r}
string3 <- c("I", "love", "methods", "camp", ".")
string3
```

## String manipulation

-   Often, strings, and more broadly text, contain information that we want to extract for the purpose of our research.
