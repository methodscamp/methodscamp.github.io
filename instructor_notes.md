This document has notes with possible changes for future iterations:

### 2025 version
**Meiying**
- The methods camp session is shorter, so we removed text analysis and AI from the curriculum.
- We find tidy data sections quite useful
- Students tend to have trouble with the R project, repository, from the very beginning. Future instructors of this camp might want to go over some of the materials in 11_wrapup.qmd at the beginning of the class, not as a conclusion
- We also recommend discussing the difference between the R language, the markdown language, and LaTeX
- We find discussing what "render" is in R and common problems with rendering helpful

### 2023 version

**Andr√©s.** A few ideas:

- In the OLS part of the matrix chapter, I'd simplify things a bit. Maybe just state (but don't explain in detail) that the RREF can solve systems of equations, and then say that some systems are unsolvable, but can be approximated via OLS (maybe show a couple of figures in which vectors are represented graphically).
- For tidy analysis II, maybe add a short subsection on themes.
- For the functions section, add the exponential function to the common functions.
- For the optimization subsection of Calculus, maybe have a motivation example explicitly on the materials.
- Add more visuals and examples for the prob/stats/sims chapter. Drawing stuff on the board was okay, but it'd be better for the students to have everything on the materials.
- Add a little bit of simple discussion about set theory and notation (for example, what $\in$ means).
- For text analysis, maybe change and `grep()` `grepl()` for the `stringr` versions, so that everything is consistent. Also maybe have the tf-idf formula in there (good practice on interpreting simple formulas).
- Maybe number the exercises automatically?
- It'd be cool to have a hex logo. And stickers, perhaps...
