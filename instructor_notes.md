### 2023 version

**Andr√©s.** A few ideas:

- In the OLS part of the matrix chapter, I'd simplify things a bit. Maybe just state (but don't explain in detail) that the RREF can solve systems of equations, and then say that some systems are unsolvable, but can be approximated via OLS (maybe show a couple of figures in which vectors are represented graphically).
- For tidy analysis II, maybe add a short subsection on themes.
- For the functions section, add the exponential function to the common functions.
- For the optimization subsection of Calculus, maybe have a motivation example explicitly on the materials.
- Add more visuals and examples for the prob/stats/sims chapter. Drawing stuff on the board was okay, but it'd be better for the students to have everything on the materials.
- For text analysis, maybe change and `grep()` `grepl()` for the `stringr` versions, so that everything is consistent. Also maybe have the tf-idf formula in there (good practice on interpreting simple formulas).
- Maybe number the exercises automatically?
- It'd be cool to have a hex logo. And stickers, perhaps...
