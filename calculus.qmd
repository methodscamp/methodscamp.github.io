# Calculus

## Theory

-   Calculus is about dealing with infinitesimal values.
-   We are going to focus on two big ideas:
    -   Derivatives
    -   Integrals

### Derviative

-   "Derivative" is just a fancy term for slope.
-   Slope is the rate of change $\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}$ or $\frac{d y}{d x}$.
-   Specifically, the derivative is the *instantaneous* rate of change.
-   We need slope for our statistics, which are all about fitting lines.
-   We also need slope for taking maxima and minima.
-   The equation for a line is $y = mx + b$. What is its slope?

### Calculating derivatives

-   Slope is rise over run, which is $\dfrac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}$
-   To see why, consider the slope of a line connecting two points: $$m = \displaystyle\frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2-x_1}$$
-   We can define $x_2 = x_1 + \Delta x$ (or equivalently $\Delta x = x_2 - x_1$) $$m = \dfrac{f(x_1+ \Delta x) - f(x_1)}{\Delta x}$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   As we've seen, for a curve, we need to be infinitely close for our line's defining points, yielding $$\lim_{\Delta x\to 0} \frac{f(x+ \Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}$$
-   This gives us this instantaneous slope (rate of change) of a function at every point on its domain. The above equation is the definition of the derivative.

### Notation

-   $\frac{d}{dx} f(x)$ is read "The derivative of $f$ of $x$ with respect to $x$." - You can also say "The instantaneous rate of change in $f$ of $x$ with respect to $x$."
-   If $y=f(x)$, $\frac{dy}{dx}$ is "The derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$". - Warning: Do not try to cancel out the $d$'s, no matter how tempting it is.
-   There is the advantage of always specifying the variable with respect to which we're differentiating (it's the one in the denominator).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lagrange's prime notation: - $f'(x)$ (read: "$f$ prime $x$") is the derivative of $f(x)$. - This is useful when it is clear which variable were are referring to (e.g., when there's only one).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   What is $\dfrac{d(x^2)}{dx}$? - $x^2$ - $2 x^{2-1}$ -$2x$

-   What is $\frac{d(4x^3)}{dx}$?

    -   $4x^3$

    -   $4*3 x^{3-1}$

    -   $12x^2$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Practice**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Evaluate the derivatives at $x=2$ and $x=-1$ $$x^3$$ $$3x^2$$ $$60x^{11}$$ $$x$$ $$\frac{4}{x^2} $$ $$9 \sqrt{x}$$ $$6 x^{5/2}$$ $$11,596,232$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Practice**

Take the derivative of each of these. $$x^3$$ $$3x^2$$ $$60x^{11}$$ $$x$$ $$\frac{4}{x^2} $$ $$9 \sqrt{x}$$ $$6 x^{5/2}$$ $$11,596,232$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Special functions

A few functions have particular rules:

-   $\frac{d (ln(x))}{dx}=\frac{1}{x}$

-   $\dfrac{d (log_b(x))}{dx}=\dfrac{1}{x*ln(b)}$

-   $\frac{d (e^x)}{dx}=e^x$

-   $\frac{d (a^x)}{dx}=a^x ln(a)$

-   $\frac{dy}{dx}c=0$

-   $\frac{d (x^x)}{dx}=x^x (1+ln(x))$

### Derivatives with addition and substraction

-   Easiest rule to remember: $$\frac{d (f(x) \pm g(x))}{dx}=f'(x) \pm g'(x)$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Practice**

Take the derivative of each of these $$x^2 + x +5$$ $$x^4 - 4x^3 + 5x^2 + 8x - 6$$ $$3x^5 - 6x^2$$ $$5x^2 + 8 \sqrt{x} - \frac{1}{x}$$ $$ln(x) + 5e^x - 4x^3$$

## Advanced rules

### Product rule


-   A little more complicated: $$\frac{d (f(x) \times g(x))}{dx}=f'(x)g(x) + g'(x)f(x)$$
-   Example: $2x \times 3x$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Practice**

Take the derivative of each of these: $$x^3 * x$$ $$e^x * x^2$$ $$ln(x) * x^{-3}$$

Remember, $\frac{d (f(x) * g(x))}{dx}=f'(x)g(x) + g'(x)f(x)$.

### Quotient rule

$$\frac{d \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}}{dx}=\frac{f'(x)g(x) - g'(x)f(x)}{[g(x)]^2}$$ If you're having trouble with this, just apply the product rule to: $$\frac{d[f(x)*g^{-1}(x)]}{dx}$$

Remember, $\frac{d \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}}{dx}=\frac{f'(x)g(x) - g'(x)f(x)}{[g(x)]^2}$.

### Chain rule

$$\frac{d [f(g(x))]}{dx}=f'(g(x)) * g'(x)$$

Let's take the derivative of a function of a function: $$\frac{d[ln(x^2)]}{dx}$$ $$f(x)=ln(x), g(x)=\color{red}{x^2}$$ $$f'(x)=\color{blue}{\frac{1}{x}}\color{black}{, g'(x)=2x}$$ $$ \frac{\color{blue}{1}}{\color{red}{x^2}}*2x = \frac{2}{x}$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Practice**

Take the derivative of each of these: $$ (3x^4-8)^2 $$ $$e^{x^2}$$ Remember, $\frac{d (f(g(x))}{dx}=f'(g(x)) * g'(x)$.

### Second derivative

-   Same process as taking single derivative, except input for second derivative is output from first.
-   Second derivative tells us whether the slope of a function is increasing, decreasing, or staying the same at any point $x$ on the function's domain.
-   Example: driving a car.
    -   $f(x)$ = distance traveled at time $x$
    -   $f'(x)$ = speed at time $x$
    -   $f''(x)$ = acceleration at time $x$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Graph $f(x) = x^2$, $f'(x)$, and $f''(x)$.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

$$\frac{d^2(x^4)}{dx^2}=f''(x^4)$$ - First, we take the first derivative: $$f'(x^4)=4x^3$$ - Then we use that output to take the second derivative: $$f''(x^4)=f'(4x^3)=12x^2$$

**Practice**

Take the second derivative of the following functions: $$x^5$$ $$6x^2$$ $$4 ln(x)$$ $$3x$$ $$4x^{3/2}$$
