# Calculus

## Theory

-   Calculus is about dealing with infinitesimal values.
-   We are going to focus on two big ideas:
    -   Derivatives
    -   Integrals

### Derviative

-   "Derivative" is just a fancy term for slope.
-   Slope is the rate of change $\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}$ or $\frac{d y}{d x}$.
-   Specifically, the derivative is the *instantaneous* rate of change.
-   We need slope for our statistics, which are all about fitting lines.
-   We also need slope for taking maxima and minima.
-   The equation for a line is $y = mx + b$. What is its slope?

### Calculating derivatives

-   Slope is rise over run, which is $\dfrac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}$
-   To see why, consider the slope of a line connecting two points: $$m = \displaystyle\frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2-x_1}$$
-   We can define $x_2 = x_1 + \Delta x$ (or equivalently $\Delta x = x_2 - x_1$) $$m = \dfrac{f(x_1+ \Delta x) - f(x_1)}{\Delta x}$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   As we've seen, for a curve, we need to be infinitely close for our line's defining points, yielding $$\lim_{\Delta x\to 0} \frac{f(x+ \Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}$$
-   This gives us this instantaneous slope (rate of change) of a function at every point on its domain. The above equation is the definition of the derivative.

### Notation

-   $\frac{d}{dx} f(x)$ is read "The derivative of $f$ of $x$ with respect to $x$." - You can also say "The instantaneous rate of change in $f$ of $x$ with respect to $x$."
-   If $y=f(x)$, $\frac{dy}{dx}$ is "The derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$". - Warning: Do not try to cancel out the $d$'s, no matter how tempting it is.
-   There is the advantage of always specifying the variable with respect to which we're differentiating (it's the one in the denominator).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lagrange's prime notation: - $f'(x)$ (read: "$f$ prime $x$") is the derivative of $f(x)$. - This is useful when it is clear which variable were are referring to (e.g., when there's only one).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   What is $\dfrac{d(x^2)}{dx}$? - $x^2$ - $2 x^{2-1}$ -$2x$

-   What is $\frac{d(4x^3)}{dx}$?

    -   $4x^3$

    -   $4*3 x^{3-1}$

    -   $12x^2$

**Practice**

Take the derivative of each of these. $$x^3$$ $$3x^2$$ $$60x^{11}$$ $$x$$ $$\frac{4}{x^2} $$ $$9 \sqrt{x}$$ $$6 x^{5/2}$$ $$11,596,232$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Evaluate the derivatives at $x=2$ and $x=-1$ $$x^3$$ $$3x^2$$ $$60x^{11}$$ $$x$$ $$\frac{4}{x^2} $$ $$9 \sqrt{x}$$ $$6 x^{5/2}$$ $$11,596,232$$
