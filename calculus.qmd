# Calculus

## Theory

- Calculus is about dealing with infinitesimal values.
- We are going to focus on two big ideas:
    - Derivatives
    - Integrals

### Derviative

- “Derivative” is just a fancy term for slope.
- Slope is the rate of change $\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}$ or $\frac{d y}{d x}$.
- Specifically, the derivative is the *instantaneous* rate of change.
- We need slope for our statistics, which are all about fitting lines.
- We also need slope for taking maxima and minima
- The equation for a line is $y = mx + b$. What is its slope?

### Calculating derivatives

- Slope is rise over run, which is $\dfrac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}$
- To see why, consider the slope of a line connecting two points:
$$m = \displaystyle\frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2-x_1}$$
- We can define $x_2 = x_1 + \Delta x$ (or equivalently $\Delta x = x_2 - x_1$)
$$m = \dfrac{f(x_1+ \Delta x) - f(x_1)}{\Delta x}$$

---

- As we've seen, for a curve, we need to be infinitely close for our line's defining points, yielding 
$$\lim_{\Delta x\to 0} \frac{f(x+ \Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}$$
- This gives us this instantaneous slope (rate of change) of a function at every point on its domain. The above equation is the definition of the derivative.

### Notation
- $\frac{d}{dx} f(x)$ &rightarrow "The derivative of $f$ of $x$ with respect to $x$."
        - You can also say "The instantaneous rate of change in $f$ of $x$ with respect to $x$."
- If $y=f(x)$, $\frac{dy}{dx}$ is "The derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$".
        - Warning: Do not try to cancel out the $d$'s, no matter how tempting it is.
- Advantage of always specifying the variable with respect to which we're differentiating (it's the one in the denominator).
