# Calculus

## Theory

- Calculus is about dealing with infinitesimal values.
- We are going to focus on two big ideas:
    - Derivatives
    - Integrals

### Derviative

- “Derivative” is just a fancy term for slope.
- Slope is the rate of change $\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}$ or $\frac{d y}{d x}$.
- Specifically, the derivative is the *instantaneous* rate of change.
- We need slope for our statistics, which are all about fitting lines.
- We also need slope for taking maxima and minima
- The equation for a line is $y = mx + b$. What is its slope?

### Calculating derivatives

- Slope is rise over run, which is $\dfrac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}$
- To see why, consider the slope of a line connecting two points:
$$m = \displaystyle\frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2-x_1}$$
- We can define $x_2 = x_1 + \Delta x$ (or equivalently $\Delta x = x_2 - x_1$)
$$m = \dfrac{f(x_1+ \Delta x) - f(x_1)}{\Delta x}$$
