# Calculus

## Theory

- Calculus is about dealing with infinitesimal values.
- We are going to focus on two big ideas:
    - Derivatives
    - Integrals

### Derviative

- “Derivative” is just a fancy term for slope.
- Slope is the rate of change $\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}$ or $\frac{d y}{d x}$.
- Specifically, the derivative is the *instantaneous* rate of change.
- We need slope for our statistics, which are all about fitting lines.
- We also need slope for taking maxima and minima
- The equation for a line is $y = mx + b$. What is its slope?

### Calculating derivatives

- Slope is rise over run, which is $\dfrac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}$
- To see why, consider the slope of a line connecting two points:
$$m = \displaystyle\frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2-x_1}$$
- We can define $x_2 = x_1 + \Delta x$ (or equivalently $\Delta x = x_2 - x_1$)
$$m = \dfrac{f(x_1+ \Delta x) - f(x_1)}{\Delta x}$$

---

- As we've seen, for a curve, we need to be infinitely close for our line's defining points, yielding 
$$\lim_{\Delta x\to 0} \frac{f(x+ \Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}$$
- This gives us this instantaneous slope (rate of change) of a function at every point on its domain. The above equation is the definition of the derivative.

### Notation
- $\frac{d}{dx} f(x)$ is read "The derivative of $f$ of $x$ with respect to $x$."
        - You can also say "The instantaneous rate of change in $f$ of $x$ with respect to $x$."
- If $y=f(x)$, $\frac{dy}{dx}$ is "The derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$".
        - Warning: Do not try to cancel out the $d$'s, no matter how tempting it is.
- There is the advantage of always specifying the variable with respect to which we're differentiating (it's the one in the denominator).

Lagrange's prime notation:
- $f'(x)$ (read: "$f$ prime $x$") is the derivative of $f(x)$.
        - This is useful when it is clear which variable were are referring to (e.g., when there's only one).

---
$$\displaystyle\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{d}{dx} f(x) = f'(x) = \displaystyle\lim_{\Delta x\to 0 } \frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}$$

## Basic rules
### Power rule
- Power rule is important for differentiation by hand.
- It tells us how to take the derivative of a polynomial.
- $\dfrac{d(ax^n)}{dx}=anx^{n-1}$
- Notation reminder: $\frac{dy}{dx}=f'(x)$

---
- What is $\dfrac{d(x^2)}{dx}$?
        - $x^2$
        - $2 x^{2-1}$
        -$2x$

---
- What is $\frac{d(4x^3)}{dx}$?
        - $4x^3$
        - $4*3 x^{3-1}$
        - $12x^2$

**Practice**

Take the derivative of each of these.
$$x^3$$
$$3x^2$$ 
$$60x^{11}$$ 
$$x$$
$$\frac{4}{x^2} $$
$$9 \sqrt{x}$$
$$6 x^{5/2}$$
$$11,596,232$$

Evaluate the derivatives at $x=2$ and $x=-1$
$$x^3$$
$$3x^2$$ 
$$60x^{11}$$ 
$$x$$
$$\frac{4}{x^2} $$
$$9 \sqrt{x}$$
$$6 x^{5/2}$$
$$11,596,232$$

### Special functions

A few functions have particular rules
- $\frac{d (ln(x))}{dx}=\frac{1}{x}$
- $\dfrac{d (log_b(x))}{dx}=\dfrac{1}{x*ln(b)}$
- $\frac{d (e^x)}{dx}=e^x$
- $\frac{d (a^x)}{dx}=a^x ln(a)$
- $\frac{dy}{dx}c=0$
- $\frac{d (x^x)}{dx}=x^x (1+ln(x))$

### Derivatives with addition and subtraction
Easiest rule to remember: 
- $\frac{d (f(x) \pm g(x))}{dx}=f'(x) \pm g'(x)$

---
**Practice**
Take the derivative of each of these:
$$x^2 + x +5$$
$$x^4 - 4x^3 + 5x^2 + 8x - 6$$
$$3x^5 - 6x^2$$
$$5x^2 + 8 \sqrt{x} - \frac{1}{x}$$
$$ln(x) + 5e^x - 4x^3$$
