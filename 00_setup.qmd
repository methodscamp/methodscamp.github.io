# Setup {.unnumbered}

## Installing R and RStudio

[R](https://cran.r-project.org/) is a programming language optimized for statistics and data analysis. Most people use R from [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/), a graphical user interface (GUI) that includes a file pane, a graphics pane, and other goodies. Both R and RStudio are open source, i.e., free as in beer and free as in freedom!

Your first steps should be to install R and RStudio, in that order (if you have installed these programs before, make sure that your versions are up-to-date---if they are not, follow the instructions below):

1. Download and install R from [the official website, CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). Click on "Download R for \<Windows/Mac\>" and follow the instructions. If you have a Mac, make sure to select the version appropriate for your system (Apple Silicon for newer M1/M2 Macs and Intel for older Macs).

2. Download and install RStudio from [the official website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). Scroll down and select the installer for your operating system.

After these two steps, you can open RStudio in your system, as you would with any program. You should see something like this:

That's it for the installation! We also *strongly* recommend that you change a couple of RStudio's default settings:[^settings]

- `Tools > Global Options > General > Uncheck "Restore .RData into workspace at startup"`

- `Tools > Global Options > General > Save workspace to .RData on Exit > Select "Never"`

- `Tools > Appearance` to change to a dark theme, if you want! Pros: better for night sessions, hacker vibes...

[^settings]: The idea behind these settings is to force R to start from scratch with each new session. No lingering objects avoids misunderstandings and helps with reproducibility!

## Setting up for Methods Camp

All materials for Methods Camp are both on this website and an [RStudio project](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects). An RStudio project is simply a folder where one keeps scripts, datasets, and other files needed for a data analysis project. 

You can [download our RStudio project here](), as a .zip compressed file. On MacOS, the file will be uncompressed automatically. On Windows, you should do `Right click > Extract all`. 

::: {.callout-warning}
Make sure to properly unzip the materials. Double-clicking the .zip file on most Windows systems *will not* unzip the folder---you must do `Right click > Extract all`. 
:::

You should now have a folder called `methodscamp/` on your computer. Navigate to the `methodscamp.Rproj` file within it and open it. RStudio should open the project right away. You should see `methodscamp` on the top-right of RStudio---this indicates that you are working in our RStudio project.

That's all for setup! We can now start coding. After opening our RStudio project, we'll begin by opening the `01_r_intro.qmd` file from the "Files" panel, in the bottom-right portion of RStudio. This is a Quarto document,[^rmarkdown] which contains both code and explanations (you can also read in the next chapter of this website). 

[^rmarkdown]: Perhaps you have used [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) before. [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is the next iteration of R Markdown, and is both more flexible and more powerful!
